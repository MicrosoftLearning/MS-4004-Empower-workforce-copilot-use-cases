# Exercise: Synthesize communication insights across Microsoft Team
---
In today's dynamic business landscape, effective communication is key to staying ahead. As executives navigate the vast ocean of information, Microsoft Teams emerges as a powerful tool they can use to streamline their communication experience. Within Teams, Copilot empowers you with a quick and efficient overview of key discussions, ensuring that you stay informed without being overwhelmed.

When you think of Microsoft Teams, you typically think of Teams' chat. However, when you use Microsoft 365 Copilot, the Copilot experience in Teams can focus not only on your chat experience, but also on your email and meeting data from Outlook. It does so through two Copilot features that are available in Teams:

- **Copilot in Teams**. Embedded directly in the Teams interface, Copilot in Teams helps you in the moment during meetings and chats. It can take notes, summarize ongoing conversations, and suggest follow-up actions. While its focus is real-time, it can also reference recent context within the same meeting or chat. To enhance responses, it uses Microsoft Graph to pull relevant files, emails, or calendar events—but only as needed for the immediate task. Because it’s built into the meeting and chat experience, you don’t need to launch it separately.

- **Copilot Chat within Teams**. Copilot Chat is a conversational assistant accessible through the Copilot button in Teams. It delivers a broader, cross-app experience across Microsoft 365, helping you with retrospective and enterprise-wide queries. It can summarize your meetings for the week, compile project updates, or answer complex questions by pulling from emails, chats, files, and calendars. Think of Copilot Chat as your enterprise-wide AI assistant, available across Microsoft 365—not just Teams.

### Scenario
For executives, their time is their most valuable asset. They’re responsible for steering critical initiatives, making informed decisions, and maintaining visibility across multiple workstreams. As part of this exercise, you use both Copilot features in Microsoft Teams to quickly synthesize the emails, meetings, and chats related to a key project that you’re currently working on—just as an executive would when preparing for a board update or strategic review.
