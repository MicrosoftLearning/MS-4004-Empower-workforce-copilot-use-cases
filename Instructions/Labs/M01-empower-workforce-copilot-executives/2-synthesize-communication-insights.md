# Synthesize your communication insights using Microsoft 365 Business Chat
---
In today's dynamic business landscape, effective communication is key to staying ahead. As executives navigate the vast ocean of information, Microsoft Teams emerges as a powerful tool they can use to streamline their communication experience. Within Teams, Copilot empowers you with a quick and efficient overview of key discussions, ensuring that you stay informed without being overwhelmed.

When you think of Microsoft Teams, you typically think of Teams' chat. However, when you use Microsoft 365 Copilot, the Copilot experience in Teams can focus not only on your chat experience, but also on your email and meeting data from Outlook. It does so through two Copilot features that are available in Teams:

- **Microsoft 365 Copilot in Teams**. This Copilot feature accesses the specific chat thread that you have open. However, it doesn't access organizational data outside of Teams. When you open a chat thread, select the **Copilot** icon in the upper-right corner of your chat page to open the **Copilot** pane for that thread. Copilot in Teams helps you quickly get up-to-speed and synthesize key information across all your Teams chat threads. By default, Copilot retrieves information from the chat thread that is up to 30 days old when you open a chat thread in Teams. You can ask Copilot to search beyond that 30 day mark if necessary.
- **Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat in Teams**. This Copilot feature accesses both your Teams' Chat experiences AND your email and meetings from Outlook. It uses the Graph-grounded chat experience that's included in your Microsoft 365 Copilot license or pay-as-you-go (metered) billing plan to access your Teams and Outlook data. To use this feature, select the **Copilot** option that appears in the Teams navigation pane. Doing so opens the Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat page within Teams.

The focus of this exercise is on Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat in Teams, which accesses your Teams and Outlook data. It's designed to streamline various aspects of your work in Microsoft Teams by working alongside users and providing suggestions and recommendations based on the context of their work. For example, it can help you:

- Quickly recap past communications (for example, "What's new from Emily?").
- Summarize long threads in a chat window into key points.
- Answer queries to help you stay updated (for example, "Who am I meeting with tomorrow?").

> This course doesn't include a Microsoft 365 lab tenant with fictitious data. Instead, you must complete this training exercise using your own personal data. 

In this training exercise scenario, you plan to use Copilot Chat in Teams to summarize the emails, meetings, and chats regarding an actual topic in your work environment. When Copilot Chat synthesizes your data in this manner, it reaches across your Microsoft 365 tenant to gather this information.

### Exercise

Think of an actual project that you participated in over the past 30 days. Amidst countless emails, meetings, and virtual discussions, you find yourself in need of a comprehensive summary of all communications related to this critical initiative. Copilot Chat in Teams is the perfect tool to synthesize all your communication history and provide a concise recap of all activity.

With a simple command, you instruct the platform to collate and distill the essence of your emails and chats pertaining to the project over the past month. In doing so, note how the tool effortlessly sifts through the information clutter. It then presents you with a concise summary that not only captures the progress made but also highlights any key decisions, challenges, and emerging trends. This exercise exemplifies how using Copilot Chat in Teams can save you valuable time while ensuring you stay well-informed and in control of the crucial aspects of your business endeavors.

Perform the following steps to direct Copilot Chat in Teams to synthesize your communications for a specific topic:

1. In **Microsoft Teams**, select **Copilot** in the navigation pane that appears on the left-side of the window. Doing so opens the **Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat** window within Teams.
1. In the **Copilot Chat** window, enter the following text in the prompt at the bottom of the page (replace "topic of your choice" with an actual project name or topic that you participated in at your organization): **Summarize all my emails, meetings, and chats over the past 30 days related to {topic of your choice}**.
1. After Copilot responds with a summary of each communication, note the prompts that appear above the main prompt field at the bottom of the page. Copilot generated these prompts based on the summarized list of data that it returned. For example, you may see prompts such as:
   - "List any action items for me"
   - "Provide more details on the meeting with {person's name}"
   - "Summarize the key decisions from these communications"
   - "Draft an email to the team about the project participation"

    Select one of these prompts to see how Copilot Chat in Teams responds. After you review the response, note how the Copilot-generated prompts change based on the prompt that you just submitted.

Note the iterative nature of this design. As you continue submitting Copilot-generated prompts, each response includes a new set of prompts associated with the data that Copilot returned. This design enables you to continue digging deeper into the communication history of the project while also requesting that Copilot perform specific tasks in follow-up, such as emailing a person or team, identifying deadlines, and so on.
