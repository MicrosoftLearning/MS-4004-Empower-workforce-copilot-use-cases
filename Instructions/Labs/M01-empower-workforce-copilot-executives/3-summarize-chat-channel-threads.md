# Summarize chat and channel threads using Microsoft 365 Copilot in Teams
---
Possessing proficiency in Microsoft 365 Copilot in Teams is a pivotal skill for executives seeking to streamline collaboration and drive actionable outcomes in their teams. In the fast-paced world of business communication, sifting through chat and channel threads to distill key action items is a time-consuming task. Copilot in Teams revolutionizes this process by intelligently analyzing conversations and generating a concise list of action items.

Executives who harness this capability not only save valuable time but also ensure that critical tasks are identified and addressed promptly. This skill not only enhances productivity within the team but also reinforces effective leadership, enabling executives to stay ahead of priorities and foster a culture of efficiency. Copilot in Teams, as a collaborative assistant, becomes an invaluable asset for executives striving to lead teams toward tangible results in the ever-evolving landscape of modern business.

When using Copilot in Teams to examine the details of a specific chat or channel, Copilot provides several predefined, commonly used prompts to select from. These predefined prompts are sometimes referred to as "starter prompts." Choosing a starter prompt saves you from having to manually type in the text associated with the prompt. A starter prompt can save you time when you don't need a customized prompt, as in the prior exercise.

Copilot in Teams uses the following guidelines to determine which prompts to display for a given chat or channel:

Copilot only includes the time-bound prompts ("Highlights from the past...") and non-time-bound prompts ("decisions/open items") if there's enough content in the time frame to warrant them. If sufficient content is present, these prompts are displayed; otherwise, they're omitted.
Copilot assesses the recency and volume of content in a chat to determine prompt availability. If there isn't enough recent content, prompts may not be displayed. However, Copilot can still answer questions based on the existing content.
Exercise
In the prior exercise, you entered your own custom prompt to request information on a project. In this exercise, you take advantage of the starter prompts that Copilot provides. The predefined prompts that Copilot displays can vary depending on the content that's available in the selected chat or channel.

Use Copilot in a Teams chat
As an executive for your organization, you want to use Copilot in Teams chat and channels to help you quickly get up to speed on conversations. In this exercise, you want Copilot to summarize the key points from the past 30 days for a specific chat. You begin by using one of Copilot's predefined prompts to gather this information. From there, you type a series of prompts to delve deeper into the results.

Select Chat from the navigation bar on the left side of Teams, and then select a chat thread that's of specific interest to you. For this first task, select a chat thread that you know extended across multiple days - perhaps a chat from a reoccurring meeting.

Select the Copilot icon in the upper-right corner of the chat.

:::image type="content" source="../media/copilot-teams-icon-da01ab29-5d1e7feb.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a chat in Teams and the Copilot icon highlighted." border="true":::

At the bottom of the Copilot pane that appears, above the prompt field, select View prompts (or the** View prompts** icon if that appears instead). In the menu that appears, the prompt suggestions vary depending on the number of days in which the chat thread was updated. For a single day thread, only "Highlights from the past day" appears. For a thread that was updated over the past week, you see "Highlights from the past day" and "Highlights from the past 7 days". And for a chat thread that was updated over the past month, you see those previous two prompts, plus "Highlights from the past 30 days." Select "Highlights from the past 30 days" if it appears; otherwise, enter the following prompt instead: Summarize this chat.

In the Copilot response, note how Copilot includes a footnoted number at the end of each statement. Each footnote provides a direct link to the highlighted statement. Select one of the footnotes for a highlighted item. When you do so, note how Copilot scrolls directly to that message in the chat thread. This feature enables you to quickly navigate to a specific highlight without having to manually scroll through the thread searching for it. Repeat this step for a couple of the highlighted items to see how valuable this feature is.

You may often find yourself interested in what a certain person said in a chat thread. Enter the following prompt (replace "name of the person" with the person's name) and select the Send icon: What did {name of the person} say?

Once Copilot generates a response, select the footnote for a particular item to scroll directly to that message. Note how this feature quickly allows you to zero in on a particular response from that person.

Open a different chat thread
When you use Copilot in Microsoft Teams, the behavior of the Copilot pane when switching between chat threads can vary based on several factors:

Pop-Out Feature. If you popped out the Copilot pane into a separate window using the pop-out icon, the pane remains open independently. In this case, when you select a new chat thread, the Copilot pane may stay open, but it might not automatically update to reflect the new chat's content. You may need to manually refresh or navigate within the Copilot pane to view information related to the new chat.

Integrated Pane. When the Copilot pane is integrated within the main Teams window, its behavior can depend on your settings and interactions. Selecting a new chat thread may cause the Copilot pane to update automatically to display prompts and information relevant to the new conversation. However, if there's insufficient content in the new chat thread, Copilot might not display any prompts, and the pane could appear empty or inactive.

Let's look now at a different chat thread.

In the Chat pane, select the chat thread for another meeting that you feel has significant messages. If the Copilot pane disappears, then select the Copilot icon for this chat to open the Copilot pane for this new thread.
At the bottom of the Copilot pane that appears, above the prompt field, select View prompts. In the menu that appears, select What decisions were made ? If this prompt doesn't appear, manually enter this prompt and select the Send icon.
Review the decisions that were made. Select a footnote for a particular item to scroll directly to that decision.
Select View prompts. In the menu that appears, select What are the open items? If this prompt doesn't appear, manually enter this prompt and select the Send icon.
Review the decisions that were made. Select a footnote for a particular item to scroll directly to that open item.
Recap a meeting
You now want to use Copilot in Teams chat to help you quickly get up to speed on a particular conversation. To do so, you plan to use one of Copilot's predefined prompts to provide a recap of the meeting. With that information in hand, you plan to type a series of prompts to delve deeper into the results. To begin, select a particular chat thread that's of interest to you to open it.

With the chat thread open, open the Copilot pane by selecting the Copilot icon in the upper-right corner of the chat.
At the bottom of the Copilot pane, select View prompts (or the** View prompts** icon if that appears instead). In the menu that appears, select Recap the meeting. If this predefined prompt doesn't appear in the menu, manually enter Recap the meeting in the prompt field and then select the Send icon.
To get a better feel for how different types of prompts can provide different results, enter the following prompt, which is fairly synonymous to the Recap the meeting prompt, and then select the Send icon: Summarize the meeting
Compare the results that you received from the predefined Recap the meeting prompt with the results from the non-predefined Summarize the meeting prompt. Note the differences generated in each response.
In the previous chat that you worked on, you selected the predefined prompts that asked Copilot in Teams "What decisions were made?" and "What are the open items?" Instead of submitting those same predefined prompts again, let's try something different. This time, enter the following prompt and select the Send icon: Did anyone appear upset at the meeting?
Note Copilot's response. Keep this response in mind as you write prompts in the future. As an AI tool, there are certain limitations to Copilot's abilities.
Use Copilot in a Teams channel
Copilot in a Teams channel works similar to Copilot in a Teams chat.

In the Chat pane, scroll down to the Teams and channels section, and then select a specific channel within a team.

Within the channel discussion, select the link below the channel post to expand the replies and see the full conversation.

From this immersive channel post view, select the Open Copilot icon in the upper-right corner of the channel view.

:::image type="content" source="../media/copilot-teams-icon-replies-c03368a6-a1086bfe.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a channel post in Teams with the response option highlighted." border="true":::

At the bottom of the Copilot pane that appears, select View prompts (or the** View prompts** icon if that appears instead). In the menu that appears, select Highlights from this conversation. If this prompt doesn't appear, manually enter this prompt and select the Send icon.

Repeat this process by selecting any of the other predefined prompts that appear or enter your own prompts. Note how footnotes appear in the Copilot responses, just as they did in the chats that you selected earlier.
