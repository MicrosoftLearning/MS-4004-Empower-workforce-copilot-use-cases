In the prior task, you entered your own custom prompt to request information on a project. In this task, you take advantage of the starter prompts that Copilot provides in Teams. The predefined prompts that Copilot displays can vary depending on the content that's available in the selected chat or channel.

As an executive for your organization, you want to use Copilot in Teams chat and channels to help you quickly get up to speed on conversations. In this task, you want Copilot to summarize the key points from the past 30 days for a specific chat. You begin by using one of Copilot's predefined prompts to gather this information. From there, you type a series of prompts to delve deeper into the results.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  In **Teams for the web**, select **Chat** from the navigation bar on the left side of **Teams**, and then select a chat thread that's of specific interest to you, especially if it’s one that extended across multiple days - perhaps a chat from a reoccurring meeting.

2.  Select the **Copilot** icon in the upper-right corner of the chat.

3.  In the **Copilot** pane that appears, several generic prompts are displayed, such as “Summarize this discussion,” “What are open items,” and “What decisions were made.” Select the **See more** option that appears below these prompts to see another series of starter prompts. Select and submit one of the starter prompts that’s of interest to you.

4.  In the Copilot response, note how Copilot includes a footnote citation at the end of each statement. Each footnote citation provides a direct link to the highlighted statement. Select one of the footnotes for a highlighted item. When you do so, note how Copilot scrolls directly to that message in the chat thread. This feature enables you to quickly navigate to a specific highlight without having to manually scroll through the thread searching for it. Repeat this step for a couple of the highlighted items to see how valuable this feature is.

5.  You might often find yourself interested in what a certain person said in a chat thread. Enter the following prompt (replace "name of the person" with the person's name) and select the **Send** icon: **What did {name of the person} say?**

6.  Once Copilot generates a response, select the footnote citation for a particular item to scroll directly to that message. Note how this feature quickly allows you to zero in on a particular response from that person.
