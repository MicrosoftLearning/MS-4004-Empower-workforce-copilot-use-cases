# Exercise 1, Task 3: Use Copilot Chat in Teams to collect cross-project insights
---
Executives often oversee several strategic initiatives at once. Staying on top of progress, risks, and trends across multiple projects can be challenging, especially when information is scattered across emails, meetings, and chats. With Copilot Chat in Teams, you can quickly compare the status of different projects, spot recurring challenges, and identify opportunities for alignment or escalation.

In this task, you plan to use Copilot Chat in Teams to synthesize and compare communications related to two or more projects you’re involved with. Doing so should help you:

- Surface high-level progress and blockers for each project.
- Identify common risks, dependencies, or trends.
- Prepare for leadership updates or cross-team coordination.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  In **Teams for the web**, open **Copilot Chat** in Teams, just like you did in Task 1.

2.  Identify two topics that are included in your Teams chat. In the Copilot Chat prompt field, ask Copilot to compare the progress, risks, and key decisions for {topic 1 of your choice} and {topic 2 of your choice} over the past 30 days. Also ask Copilot to summarize the major milestones and updates for each project, key decisions that were made, outstanding risks or blockers, and any trends, recurring issues, or dependencies between the projects.

3.  Review Copilot’s response. Also review the follow-up prompts that Copilot suggests. Select a prompt or enter your own to dig deeper into specific areas.

4.  Review Copilot’s response. To help clarify the insights that it gathered, ask Copilot to generate a side-by-side comparison table for the two topics. You plan to use this table to prepare for executive briefings and cross-team syncs on these topics.


5.  Even though you’re working within Teams, you can still have Copilot generate an email for you. Ask Copilot to draft an email to the project team related to one of the selected topics. The email should list the action items for the topic, and any unresolved risks associated with the topic. While Copilot doesn’t generate the actual email in Outlook, it does enable you to copy the email contents that it created so that you can paste it into a new email in Outlook. You aren't sending the email, so you can refrain from copying the email contents.
