# Exercise 1, Task 4: Use Copilot in Teams to prepare an executive summary
---
Once executives analyze communications across projects, they often need to distill their findings into a concise, executive-ready deliverable—such as a briefing summary, leadership update, or presentation slide. Copilot can help transform synthesized insights into professional outputs that communicate progress and priorities clearly.

In this task, you use Copilot in Teams to generate a polished, ready-to-share summary based on your prior analysis. You then explore how Copilot can adapt that same content for different communication formats.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  In **Teams for the web**, open **Copilot Chat**.

2.  Refer to the insights you gathered in **Task 3**. In the Copilot Chat prompt field, ask Copilot to create a concise executive summary of the key findings, risks, and next steps for {topic 1} and {topic 2} that you can share in a leadership meeting (replace placeholders with your project names).

3.  Review Copilot’s response. Did it structure the summary into clear sections, such as Overview, Highlights, Risks, and Recommendations. If not, then ask it to do so.

4.  Review the response. Ask Copilot to reformat this summary into bullet points suitable for a slide deck.

5.  You’re anticipating that you can reuse this summary for presentations to other teams as well. Ask Copilot to draft a short Teams post you can share with both project teams summarizing the key takeaways.

6.  Review the results. Observe how Copilot can tailor the same information differently for executive briefings versus team communications. Consider how this feature supports consistent yet audience-specific messaging.

7.  Note any suggested prompts that Copilot displayed. Feel free to submit any of them to see how Copilot can transform analytical insights into clear, shareable communications.
