# Exercise 1, Task 3: Use Copilot in Word to create a sales proposal
---
Now that you built a strong understanding of the market and competition, Fabrikam’s regional Sales director asks you to prepare a client-ready proposal that can be used in upcoming sales meetings with hotel groups. The proposal should clearly articulate EcoSense 360’s value, highlight customer benefits, and demonstrate the potential return on investment (ROI).

You want to use Copilot in Word to transform your research findings into a professional, persuasive sales proposal. You want it to be visually clean, executive-friendly, and tailored to hotel decision makers.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  In your Microsoft Edge browser, go to the **Microsoft 365** home page, select **Apps** in the navigation pane, and then select **Word** from the **Apps** menu.

2.  In **Word for the web**, create a blank document.

3.  In the Copilot prompt that appears above the document, ask Copilot to create a sales proposal for Fabrikam’s EcoSense 360 energy management solution that’s tailored for hotel and resort clients. It should include an executive summary, customer pain points, solution overview, ROI benefits, and a short success story. It should draw its information from both the Word file generated by the Researcher agent in Task 1 and the **EcoSense360 market research.docx** file that you created in Task 2. Attach both files to the Copilot prompt.

4.  Review the proposal that Copilot generated. You notice that while the sales proposal includes a section on customer pain points, it doesn’t mention how Fabrikam’s EcoSense 360 energy management solution addresses those issues. In the Copilot prompt field that now appears at the bottom of the window, ask Copilot to generate update the Customer Pain Points section to include how the EcoSense 360 solution addresses each pain point.

5.  Review the results. Did Copilot create a new draft (2 of 2) that includes just the pain point section, albeit an updated version that includes content on how the EcoSense 360 addresses each issue? If so, then in draft 2 of 2 (the pain point section and how EcoSense 360 addresses them) and ask Copilot to generate the entire sales proposal from draft 1, but update it to include this pain point content from draft 2.

6.  The updated proposal that includes the new pain point section should now appear in draft 3 of 3. In draft 3 of 3, ask Copilot to rewrite this proposal for a C-level audience focused on operational efficiency and sustainability. Also add a summary table showing estimated ROI for hotels of different sizes.

7.  You’re satisfied with this final version of the sales proposal, so go ahead and keep it. The one thing that you might need to change is in the pain points section (which might be retitled to something else, such as Key Operational Challenges). If Copilot includes a bullet for how EcoSense 360 addresses each pain point, ensure the **EcoSense 360 Impact** sub-bullets are indented below their parent bullets. That way, the bulleted list clearly draws attention to the EcoSense 360 solution for each pain point, as opposed to having what appears to be just a continuous string of bullets. For example:

    If your current version appears something like this:
    - **High Energy Cost:** Hotels are facing rising energy expenses…
    - **EcoSense 360 Impact:** AI-driven optimization…
    - **HVAC Inefficiency:** Outdated or disconnected climate controls…
    - **EcoSense 360 Impact:** Integrated system connects with…

    Then indent each **EcoSense 360 Impact** sub-bullet like this:<br/>
    - **High Energy Cost:** Hotels are facing rising energy expenses…
        - **EcoSense 360 Impact:** AI-driven optimization…
    - **HVAC Inefficiency:** Outdated or disconnected climate controls…
        - **EcoSense 360 Impact:** Integrated system connects with…  

8.  Save the final version of your document as **EcoSense360 Hospitality Proposal.docx**.
