At this point, you used Microsoft 365 Copilot to help complete your market research and create a sales proposal. You’re now ready to start building relationships. Your first target is the Contoso Hospitality Group, a major hotel chain known for its sustainability initiatives. You identified their VP of Operations as the key decision-maker and want to send a personalized email introducing Fabrikam’s EcoSense 360 solution.

You want to use Copilot in Outlook to craft a professional, persuasive message that references key industry challenges and positions Fabrikam as the ideal partner to help Contoso reduce energy costs and enhance operational efficiency.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  In your Microsoft Edge browser, go to the **Microsoft 365** home page, select **Apps** in the navigation pane, and then select **Outlook** from the **Apps** menu.

2.  In **Outlook on the web**, create a new email. Attach the **EcoSense360 Hospitality Proposal.docx** file that you created in the prior task.

3.  In the body of the message, select the **Open Copilot** (pencil) icon that appears next to the attached file.

4.  The Copilot window that appears contains a prompt field and a menu of edit options below it. In the prompt field, ask Copilot to create a professional email to the VP of Operations at Contoso Hospitality Group introducing Fabrikam’s EcoSense 360 solution that references key insights from the attached sales proposal file. Keep the message concise and persuasive.

5.  Review the results.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If you attach a file to your email before submitting your Copilot prompt, as in this task, Outlook assumes you want Copilot to help draft or modify the message. In this case, Copilot opens a draft window and places its response there. From that point on, you can continue working with Copilot directly in the draft, asking it to revise, expand, or refine the content until you’re ready to insert it into the body of the email. However, if you don’t attach a file, then Copilot doesn’t use draft mode. Instead, it generates its response directly within the body of your current email. After that, you’ll need to highlight the specific text you want Copilot to modify, whether that’s a sentence, a paragraph, or the entire email. Later in this task, once you insert the drafted email, you use this method to modify the email contents.

6.  Note how the drafted email appears in a separate window and not in the actual body of the email. This version is the first draft of the email. You can continue modifying this draft until you’re satisfied with it and you want to insert it into the actual email itself. You want to keep modifying this draft, so in the Copilot window that appears below the draft, asks Copilot to include key return on investment (ROI) details from the attached sales proposal.

7.  Review the results. As you review this draft version, you feel that it would be more effective to include the ROI statistics in a bulleted list rather than paragraph form. Ask Copilot to make this change. Note – If your draft already includes the ROI statistics in a bulleted list, then ask Copilot to change them from a bulleted list to paragraph form.

8.  Review the results. You’re satisfied with this final update, so you’re ready to insert the draft into the actual email. In the Copilot menu, select the **Replace** option to replace the existing email (which is blank) with this final draft.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you preferred one of the earlier drafts, you could select the forward or backward arrows to view each draft. Ensure the draft you want to use is displayed when you select the **Replace** option since that’s the draft that Copilot replaces the email with.

9.  Review the results. Note how Copilot inserted the draft into the actual body of the email. Now, once you use Copilot to draft the initial email, you can still use it to modify the email even after inserting the draft.
    - When modifying an actual email message, you must highlight the portion of the email that you want changed, whether it be a sentence, paragraph, or the entire email.
    - Or if you want Copilot to add more text to the email, you must position the cursor where you want Copilot to insert the text.

    <br/>In looking at the email, you decide to make one more change. You want to add a paragraph that discusses a post-installation partnership. Position your cursor in the email where you want the new paragraph to appear. When you do so, note how Copilot displays the **Open Copilot** (pencil) icon.

10.  Select the **Open Copilot** icon. In the Copilot window that appears, ask Copilot to add a paragraph about how Fabrikam partners with its clients’ during post-installation.

11.  Review the results. Note how Copilot opened a new draft window with just this paragraph. You can continue to make changes to this paragraph just as you did with the initial email draft. Once you’re satisfied with the paragraph, select the **Insert below** option to insert the new paragraph below where the cursor is located.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Let’s assume you highlighted a sentence, paragraph, or the entire email that you wanted Copilot to rewrite. In that case, you would select the **Replace** option rather than the **Insert below** option.

12.  Review the results. After re-reading the paragraph that you just added, you aren’t sure about its tone, so you want to try different tones until you find one that agrees with you. Drag your cursor over the paragraph that you just added to highlight it, and then select the **Open Copilot** icon that appears.

13.  In the Copilot menu, scroll down and select **Change Tone** and then select the tone that you want from the menu that’s displayed.

14.  Review the results of the modified paragraph that appears in the draft window. You still aren’t satisfied with the way the paragraph sounds, so try a different tone.

15.  Review the results. You don’t care for this version either. You’re not happy with either of the predefined Tone options, so this time you decide to ask Copilot to change the tone by making it sound friendly and confident but still professional.

16.  Review the results. You want to compare each version, so select the backward and forward arrows to go back through the prior drafts of this paragraph. Review each one, and when you finally decide on one to use, make sure that’s the one displayed in the draft window. Then select the **Replace** option to replace the current version of the paragraph with this selected draft version.

17.  Note how Copilot replaces the original version of the paragraph with this modified version. You're now finished with the email. If you want, go ahead and send it to your personal email address and then verify you received the email and it contains the attached document.
