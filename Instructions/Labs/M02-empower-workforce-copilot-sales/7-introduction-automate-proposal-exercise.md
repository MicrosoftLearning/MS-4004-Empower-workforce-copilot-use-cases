# Exercise 2: Automate sales proposal responses using Microsoft 365 Copilot
---
Responding to Requests for Proposals (RFPs) is a critical part of the sales cycle, especially in industries where large, complex deals depend on detailed technical and compliance information. For Fabrikam’s Sales organization, each RFP represents a high-value opportunity to showcase the company’s innovative EcoSense 360 energy management solution to potential clients in the hospitality sector. However, managing RFPs can also be time-consuming and resource-intensive, requiring close collaboration between Sales, Product, and Operations teams to gather accurate information and craft compelling responses.

In this exercise, you experience how Microsoft Copilot can help transform this traditionally manual process into a more efficient, scalable, and data-driven workflow. When you create an RFP response agent using the Copilot Studio lite experience, you should see how Copilot can serve as both an automation tool and a digital sales assistant—able to provide quick, consistent answers to customer questions while freeing your team to focus on building relationships and closing deals.

### Scenario

In this exercise, you continue in your role as a Sales Executive at Fabrikam, Inc. You played a key role in driving adoption of EcoSense 360, the company’s next-generation smart energy management solution. After Fabrikam’s initial success introducing EcoSense 360 to the hospitality market, interest from hotels and resorts grew rapidly—and with it, a surge of Requests for Proposals (RFPs) from potential clients.

Each RFP is an opportunity, but also a challenge. The requests vary widely in format and complexity, and responding to them demands significant time from Sales, Product Management, and Engineering teams. Common questions, such as integration compatibility, sustainability metrics, and expected cost savings, are asked repeatedly across submissions. Given your recent success with using Copilot, Fabrikam’s leadership wants you to find a smarter, faster way to manage this process.

Your goal is to build an RFP response agent in Microsoft 365 Copilot that can deliver consistent, accurate preliminary answers to customer inquiries about the EcoSense 360 energy management solution. The agent should help your Sales team respond more efficiently while maintaining a professional, customer-focused experience. To achieve this goal, you plan to use various Microsoft 365 Copilot tools to plan, build, and refine your solution.
