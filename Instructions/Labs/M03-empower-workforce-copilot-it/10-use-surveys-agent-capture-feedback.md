# Exercise 2, Task 4: Use the Surveys agent to create a feedback survey
---
One month after the feature rollout, VanArsdel’s CIO wants to know how employees are responding. Are they trying the new features? Are they running into problems? To gather this data, IT plans to distribute a short internal survey to measure adoption and satisfaction.

You want to use the Surveys agent in Microsoft 365 Copilot to brainstorm and design this survey layout—including question types, structure, and branching logic. Your goal is to design an eight question survey (five scaled and three open-text) to capture meaningful feedback about users’ experience with the new features. Once you design the survey layout, you plan to copy and paste it into Microsoft Forms with the help of Copilot in Forms.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  In the **Microsoft 365** home page, select **All agents**, then browse through the list of prebuilt agents and select the **Surveys** agent.

2.  Ask the **Surveys** agent to create a new survey that captures feedback on VanArsdel’s employee experience with the new Microsoft 365 features (attach the document containing the features from Task 1). The survey should include the following features:
    - A one-sentence introduction
    - Eight questions: five of which should be quantitative (Likert scales, multiple choice) and three open-text questions
    - Branching rules: If the employee answer "No" to any of the adoption questions, then ask a follow-up, open-text question in which they must explain why they didn’t adopt the feature.

3.  Review the results. While it appears to be a good starting point, you feel that it can be improved with just some minor tweaks. Ask it to include one demographic question that asks what department they’re in. Also, if the Likert scale questions don't provide text for each 1-5 option, then have it add text for all options. For example, if 1 is **Very difficult** and 5 is **Very easy**, but 2-4 have no explanations, then have it provide an explanation for 2-4 as well. 

4.  Once you’re satisfied with the survey, select the Copilot icon to copy the response.

5.  Your next step is to paste the copied survey into Microsoft Forms. In the **Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat** window, select the **Apps** icon in the navigation pane. In the **Apps** menu that appears, select **All apps**. Under the top section of apps in the **Apps** window, select **All apps→**. In the **All apps** window, select **Forms**.

6.  In the **Forms** window, create a new form. Paste in the copied survey in the **Draft with Copilot** window and submit your request.

7.  Review the results. You’re currently in draft mode (1 of 1), so if you’re satisfied with the current draft, select the **Keep it** button. Or, you can request other changes from Copilot. Select **Keep it** on any subsequent draft that you’re satisfied with. Or, use the forward and backward arrows to go to a specific draft that you like and then keep that particular draft.


8.  Once Copilot keeps the draft that you selected, it might indicate that it has other suggestions for your form. View those suggestions. For each suggestion, you can view how it affects your form. For example, select the suggestion to modernize the form theme, and then select a theme. Note the change to the form. You can then either discard or keep the change.
