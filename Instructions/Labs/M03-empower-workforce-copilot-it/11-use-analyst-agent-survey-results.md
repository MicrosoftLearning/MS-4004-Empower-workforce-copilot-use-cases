# Exercise 2, Task 5: Use the Analyst agent to analyze survey results
---
The survey results are in, so you must now brief the leadership team on adoption progress, user sentiment, and recommended next steps. To do so, you must analyze the survey data and produce a summary highlighting what’s working and where users need help.

By using the Analyst agent in Microsoft 365 Copilot, you plan to uncover trends, visualize adoption metrics, and generate a concise summary report. Your goal is to analyze the survey data to produce three charts, a five-bullet executive summary, and a short list of recommended IT actions to improve adoption.

> [!NOTE]
> To support the scenario used throughout this exercise, we created a spreadsheet containing employee survey responses to eight questions generated by the Surveys agent during our testing. The spreadsheet contains 500 fictitious employee responses for use in this training exercise.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  Select the following link to download **VanArsdel M365 Survey Results.xlsx** and then store it in your OneDrive account so that Copilot can access it from your tenant.

2.  Open the **VanArsdel M365 Survey Results.xlsx** spreadsheet and review the results. You might have to expand each column width to see the full extent of the answers. Close the spreadsheet once you’re done. 

3.  Return to Copilot Chat. In the Microsoft 365 navigation pane, select the **Analyst** agent.

4.  In the **Analyst** agent, attach the **VanArsdel M365 Survey Results.xlsx** spreadsheet.

5.  Ask the **Analyst** agent to analyze the attached employee survey results and provide the following feedback:

    - A five-bullet executive summary (top three positives, top two concerns)

    - Three charts: Adoption rate by department, Ease-of-use score distribution, Top blockers frequency

    - A prioritized list of five recommended IT actions (quick wins first)

    - Any statistically significant patterns (if present)

6.  Review the results. If the Analyst agent offers any suggested prompts, feel free to select and submit them if they interest you.

7.  Ask the Analyst agent if there are any correlations that can be drawn from the data.

8.  Review the response. If the Analyst agent offers any suggested prompts related to the correlations that it found, feel free to select and submit them if they interest you.

9. Since you’re one of the leaders from the IT department, you’re curious as to the responses from members of the IT department. Ask the Analyst agent to filter the data to show responses from only the IT department.

10.  Review the response. If the Analyst agent offers any suggested prompts related to the IT responses, feel free to select and submit them if they interest you.

11. Finally, ask the Analyst agent to produce a one-page executive summary report for download, along with a polished executive slide deck that contains all these insights and charts for leadership review.

12.  If the Analyst agent offers any suggested prompts related to these downloads, feel free to select and submit them if you wish.


13.  Download the summary report and the slide deck and review each document.
