# Exercise 1, Task 1: Use Copilot Chat to define the project framework
---
This task demonstrates how Copilot Chat can accelerate the early stages of project planning and ensure alignment across IT, business, and leadership teams.

You’re the lead member of Boulder Innovation’s IT team responsible for implementing the Network Modernization and Security Upgrade Project. Before any work can begin, the CIO wants a clear understanding of the project’s purpose, goals, deliverables, and stakeholders. The CIO tasked your team with gathering and synthesizing all relevant information from project documents, email threads, and chat logs to create a coherent project framework that guides the team’s planning and execution.

To complete this task, you plan to use Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat to gather and synthesize information from multiple sources across their organization. In this scenario, Copilot Chat acts as a bridge between fragmented data—emails, Teams discussions, and project documents—allowing your IT team to quickly generate a unified view of project requirements and stakeholder expectations.

> [!NOTE]
> Since this course is based on a bring-your-own-subscription (BYOS) model, it doesn’t use a simulated lab/demo environment for Boulder Innovations. As such, there’s no Microsoft 365 system to access. This lab addresses this situation by using simulated emails, which are presented in Word (.docx) files. They include sender, recipient, subject, date, and message content. Even though this task uses Word documents to emulate email threads, Copilot Chat can read and summarize the content just like it would with real emails. Similarly, the Teams chat messages are provided in a text (.txt) file to simulate real project discussions in a simple, accessible format. In a real corporate environment, these conversations would be stored in Teams, but for this training exercise, the text file allows all learners to upload and use the content with Copilot Chat without needing access to a live Teams channel. The format preserves the sender, timestamp, and message content, so you can practice summarizing and extracting key information exactly as you would with actual chat messages.  

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  The following documents emulate various emails, Teams messages, and documents across Boulder Innovations (BI) that reference the Network Modernization and Security Upgrade Project. Select each of the following links to download their respective files and store them in your OneDrive account:
    - [**BI Project Proposal Draft.docx**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2347512)
    - [**BI Email Thread – Budget Discussion.docx**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2347806)
    - [**BI Teams Chat Export.txt**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2347513)
    - [**BI Meeting Notes – Stakeholder Brief.docx**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2347511)
    - [**BI Email – Vendor Quote Summary.docx**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2347510)
    - [**BI Security Risk Memo.docx**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2347807)
        
2.  In your Microsoft Edge browser, sign in to the **Microsoft 365** home page **(https://www.microsoft365.com)**.

3.  Ask Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat to summarize all project requirements from those sources. It should identify key stakeholders and outline the project’s purpose, objectives, and expected deliverables. Have it Create a concise project framework summary that you can share with leadership. It should also map each section to its sources.
  
   > [!NOTE]
   > For this first prompt, we’ve provided the text so you can see what an effective prompt looks like when it incorporates the four key elements discussed in the Introduction unit. You must write all remaining prompts in this exercise, but in doing so, you can use this prompt as a model to emulate.

   **Summarize Boulder Innovation’s ‘Network Modernization and Security Upgrade’ project using the attached documents. Create a concise framework for leadership that covers: purpose and scope, top objectives, key deliverables, milestones, risks, and stakeholders. Cite your sources (file names and dates) and note any conflicting details. Present the summary in short sections and bullet points, followed by an appendix that maps each section to its sources.**

4.  Review the results. When you’re finished, ask Copilot to turn the results into a formatted Word document that you can download and share with the CIO.

5.  Download the document that Copilot generated and move it from your **Downloads** folder to your **OneDrive** folder.

6.  Open the file in Word and review it. Verify that it contains all the requested information.

7.  In reviewing the document, you feel that it could use some visuals to enhance a few of the sections. Ask Copilot in Word to suggest some images, charts, or SmartArt graphics that can enhance the content.

8.  From the list of suggestions, select one that you would like Copilot to generate and ask it to generate that image.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Due to time constraints and the time it takes Copilot to generate images, limit your request to one image.

9.  After Copilot generates your requested image, ask it to insert the image into the document for you. Originally, Copilot in Word didn’t have the ability to directly insert images into documents. However, features are continually being added to Copilot in Word, so by the time you perform this exercise, it might be able to insert the image for you. If it still can’t insert the image, then feel free to follow the step-by-step instructions it provides to insert the image into your document if you so choose.

10.  Finally, you feel that a Question and Answer (Q&A) section would be helpful for leadership. Ask Copilot to create a Q&A section and generate potential questions and answers based on the document content for study or review.

11.  Review the Q&A section that Copilot generated in the Copilot pane. If you’re satisfied with it, proceed to the next step. However, if you feel the questions and answers simply rephrase existing document bullets, then ask Copilot to generate a different set of questions that provoke deeper thinking, challenge assumptions, or connect the project to broader contexts.

12.  When you’re satisfied with a set of questions and answers, then select the **Add to doc (+)** icon.

   > [!CAUTION]
   > When you select the **Add to doc (+)** icon, Copilot inserts the content at the location of your cursor in the document. Therefore, before you select the **Add to doc (+)** icon, verify your cursor is located where you want the new Q&A section inserted; for example, either before or after the Source Mapping appendix.

13.  You plan to use this document in Task 3 as the basis for an executive presentation.
