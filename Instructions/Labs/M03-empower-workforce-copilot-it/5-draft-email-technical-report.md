# Draft an email based on a technical report using Microsoft 365 Copilot in Outlook
---
Microsoft 365 Copilot in Outlook is an AI-powered tool that can help IT professionals save time and effort when drafting custom emails and email replies. With Copilot, you can quickly generate email drafts that Copilot tailors to your specific needs, without having to spend hours writing and editing them. Copilot can analyze your writing style and content and then suggest phrases and sentences that are relevant to the email you're composing. This functionality can save you time and effort by reducing the amount of time you spend thinking about what to write.

In this exercise, you use Copilot in Outlook to draft a new email based on the report that you updated in the prior exercise.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Copilot scenarios in Outlook are only available on a user's primary mailbox. They aren't available on a user's archive mailbox, group mailboxes, or shared and delegate mailboxes that the user has access to. Microsoft only supports Copilot in Outlook on mailboxes hosted on Exchange Online. Additionally, Copilot in Outlook is only supported in Microsoft 365 work or school accounts and Microsoft accounts with specific email domains. It's supported through Microsoft 365 Copilot with your Microsoft Entra ID account and Copilot Pro with your MSA account. Any Microsoft account that uses a third-party email provider can still access Outlook, but it can't access Copilot features in Outlook.

Copilot can create multiple drafts of the same email, each with a different tone and length. You can then navigate through the various drafts by selecting forward and backward arrows until you find a draft version that you like. Copilot tells you which draft you're on, such as 2 of 5, 3 of 5, and so on. As such, you can select the forward or backward arrow to quickly return to a particular version.

As you review a generated draft, remember to keep in mind the following best practices that you learned in earlier training:

- Note the salutation at the start (Dear/Hello/Hi there, etc.) and the complementary close at the end (Sincerely/Best regards/Thank you, etc.). Are they in the proper tone for the target audience and the type of message that you want to send?
- Note the overall tone of the message. Is it too casual, too formal, or too direct for the type of email that you want?
- Note the length of the message. Is it too short, where it doesn't explain topics in sufficient detail? Or does it continue for too long, explaining items in too much detail given the target audience for the email? 
- Does the message explain items (especially technical items) in terms that are too simplistic or complicated given the target audience?

### Exercise

In the prior exercise, you took on the role of Trey Research's lead consultant who is responsible for managing the installation of a VPN in Fabrikam's corporate network. In that exercise, you downloaded a report titled **Trey Research - VPN Technical Overview.docx**, which you then updated using Microsoft 365 Copilot in Word.

In this exercise, you continue in that role. With your report now finalized, you're ready to schedule a meeting with Fabrikam's IT staff to present the findings from the report. Fabrikam is new to the world of VPNs, so you plan to use this meeting to educate them on VPNs before you start the installation. You want to use Copilot in Outlook to create an email to Fabrikam's IT staff to discuss this upcoming meeting. You also want to use the email to prepare the staff for the meeting by summarizing the findings of the report. Perform the following steps to create the email using Copilot in Outlook:

1. On the **Microsoft 365** home page, select **Apps** in the navigation pane, and then select **Outlook** from the **Apps** page.
1. In **Outlook**, select **New mail** on the ribbon to open a new email.
1. Select the **Attach file** option in the **Message** ribbon. In the menu that appears, the **Trey Research - VPN Technical Overview.docx** file should appear in the list of **Suggested files**. Select this file. It may take a few seconds, but the file name should appear at the top of the body of the message. On the **Message** tab, select **Copilot** on the far right-side of the ribbon. In the drop-down menu that appears, select **Draft**.
1. In the body of the message, a **Copilot** window appears. Below the **What do you want this email to say**? prompt field is a list of **Suggested prompts**. These prompts apply to various email types that you can select from. Rather than using one of these suggested prompt types, you decide to enter the following prompt in the **What do you want this email to say**? field: **I'm the Lead Consultant for Trey Research. I'll be managing the implementation of a VPN in Fabrikam's corporate network. Draft an email to Fabrikam's IT staff indicating that I would like to meet with them to introduce them to VPNs and explain how we'll be implementing one in their network. Most of the meeting will be based on the attached report, which provides an overview of VPNs. Tell them that a meeting request will be forthcoming**.
1. Select the **Generate** button that appears in the prompt field.
1. Review the email draft that Copilot generated. Even if you're satisfied with it, for this exercise, you're going to generate multiple Copilot drafts so that you can see examples of how Copilot changes the content based on changes to Tone and Length.
1. Below the message, Copilot displays a menu that allows you to Replace, Insert below, Discard, or modify the content in various ways. At this point, you're happy with the message, but you want to see how it would change when using a different tone and length. Scroll down to the bottom of the menu and select **Change Tone**. In the menu that appears, select **Direct**. Doing so triggers Copilot to generate a new draft of the email with a more direct tone. 
1. Review the Copilot draft. At the bottom of the draft window, note how Copilot indicates this draft is "**2 of 2**." This message means you're looking at the second of two Copilot drafts. You can select the back arrow (<) to go back to the previous Copilot draft, which in this case is the first draft that has a **Formal** tone. If you generate multiple Copilot drafts, as you do in this exercise, you can use these arrows to go back and forth between drafts to find one that you like. If you find a draft that you want, you can either keep it or apply another option change to that specific draft. 
1. Make sure you're on draft **2 of 2**. Note the salutation and complementary close, and the overall tone of the message for this Direct draft. This time, change the tone to **Casual**. Note the change in tone throughout the draft from a direct tone to a casual tone. 
1. You should now have three drafts. Draft 1 should have the default Formal tone, draft 2 should have a Direct tone, and Draft 3 should have a Casual tone. There's one more Tone option that you can apply, which is **Like a Poem**. While you're sure you don't want your email in this format, curiosity has gotten the better and you want to see what this email looks like with this tone. Change the Tone to **Like a Poem**. After reviewing the draft using this poem-like tone, it's readily apparent that version isn't meant for a professional email. 
1. Based on the first three drafts that Copilot created, select the one that you prefer to use. Since you're currently on draft 4 of 4, select the **Back** arrow to navigate back to the draft you prefer. 
1. On this draft, you don't feel that the email should be any shorter, but you're curious what a longer version would look like. In the menu, select **Make it longer**.
1. Note how Copilot generates a fifth draft based on the draft you selected. However, this time it created a longer version. After reviewing this draft (5 of 5), you feel this version is the one you want to use. Once you're satisfied with the tone and length of a message, you may still be unsatisfied with the text of the message itself. If you don't want to change the tone or length, you can still have Copilot regenerate a new message using the desired tone and length without asking for any more changes. Or you can enter a prompt that asks Copilot to make a change to the existing draft.
1. In this case, you decide to have Copilot to make a change to the body of the message. You want Copilot to mention the importance of reviewing the attached report prior to the meeting. You also want to ask the staff to pay close attention to the section on **Implementation best practices**. In the prompt field at the top of the menu, enter the following message and then select the **Generate** arrow icon: **Please add a note about how important it is for them to review the report prior to the meeting. Let them know that your presentation at the meeting assumes they have done so and are familiar with the basic information provided in the report. Also ask them to pay special attention to the section on Implementation best practices**.
1. Scroll through the updated draft to review the changes. After reviewing this latest iteration, you're satisfied with the draft. If an email doesn't include an attached file, the menu would include a **Keep it** option that would convert the selected draft into the actual email message. But with a file attached in the body of the message, the draft must be inserted below the file when you want to keep the draft. As such, select the **Insert below** option in the menu.
1. Note how the message appears in the body of the email and the **Copilot** draft window disappears. At this point, you can manually review the email and make any changes that you desire. Once you insert a Copilot draft into your actual email, you must manually make any further changes yourself. You can't go back into Copilot draft mode with that message.
1. Since you aren't sending this message, select the trash can (**Discard**) icon in the upper right corner of the email screen to delete this email, and then select **OK** to confirm the deletion.
