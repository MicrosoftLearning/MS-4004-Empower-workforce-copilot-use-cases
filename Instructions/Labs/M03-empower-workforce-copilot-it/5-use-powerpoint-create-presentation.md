Boulder's CIO asked you to present a briefing on the status of the Network Modernization project, including key milestones, risks, and next steps. To do so, you want to use Copilot in PowerPoint to turn your project plan and risk analysis into a clear, executive-ready presentation that communicates the project’s current status, progress, and anticipated outcomes.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  In your Microsoft Edge browser, go to the **Microsoft 365** home page, select **Apps** in the navigation pane, and then select **PowerPoint** from the **Apps** menu.

2.  In **PowerPoint for the web**, create a blank presentation.

3.  In the Copilot menu that appears on the title slide for the blank presentation, select the **Create a new presentation with file** option.

4.  In the **Create a presentation with Copilot** window, attach the Word files that you created in Tasks 1 and 2. Then ask Copilot to create an executive presentation for the Network Modernization project. The presentation should summarize the key information from the two attached files.

5.  Copilot in PowerPoint uses this information to generate a list of presentation topics. It doesn’t generate the slides until you select the **Generate slides** button. Instead, it presents the topics first so that you can modify them, if necessary, before creating the slides.

6.  You can rearrange the order of the topics if you wish. Each topic group includes the main topic title and a list of subtopics. If you hover inside the topic area, a **Reorder Topic** icon appears to the left of the topic. Continue to hold down this icon and then drag and drop the entire topic section up or down in the list to move it to a different place in the presentation.

7.  If you wish to remove a topic from the presentation, hover over the topic and then select the **Delete** (trash can) icon that appears.

8.  When you finalize the list of topics, select the **Generate slides** button.

9.  Once Copilot finishes generating the slide presentation, it displays the slides in **Slide Sorter** view. In the PowerPoint ribbon, select **View**. In the **View** ribbon, note the **Slide Sorter** option is selected in the **Presentation Views** group. Select **Normal** to view the slides in the traditional order. You're now free to review the slides and make any necessary updates. You can use the **Designer** tool to adjust the layouts. To do so, select the **Home** tab and then select the **Designer** button, which appears to the left of the **Copilot** button.

10. The **Designer** pane offers samples of different designs for the current slide being displayed. Change to a different slide in the presentation and note how the **Designer** pane generates different design options for that slide. Select one of the design options to have PowerPoint replace the current slide with the new design. This feature isn't Copilot-related. However, it's available in PowerPoint when you have a Microsoft 365 subscription, so feel free to try it here if you never used it before.

11. Now let's see what else Copilot can do. There are two ways to use Copilot in PowerPoint:

    - The **Copilot** icon that appears above the first slide can directly change the open deck. You can use this Copilot feature to add a slide or topic (a section with multiple slides) to the presentation.

    - If you select the **Copilot** button on the far end of the **Home** tab, the **Copilot Chat** pane opens. While the Chat pane starts a chat with Copilot, it generally can’t push changes directly into the slide deck. Instead, you must copy/paste from its responses.

    After reviewing the slides, you decide to add three discussion slides. You want these slides to act as placeholders to begin discussions during the presentation, so no text should appear on the slides other than the discussion topic. You want to add a slide for each of the following discussion topics:

    - Operational and business continuity risk
    - Security, compliance, and data protection
    - Budget, value, and delivery confidence
  
    Since you want to conduct these discussions after you complete the presentation, scroll down to the end of the slides in the slide pane and select after the final slide. Positioning your cursor after the final slide indicates to Copilot where to begin inserting the new slides.

12. To add slides to the presentation, select the **Copilot** icon that appears above the first slide. In the menu, select **Add a topic**.

13.  In the **Add a topic** window that appears, it displays the topics you requested and the slides within each topic. The final topic is highlighted, and an **Add a new topic** (+) icon appears. Select the **plus sign** (+) to insert your new topic section after the final topic.

    - In the **Describe the topic to add** window, ask Copilot to add a topic section titled **Discussions: Risk, Security, and Value**. The topic should include three slides – one for **Operational and business continuity risk**, another for **Security, compliance, and data protection**, and a final slide for **Budget, value, and delivery confidence**.

    - Select the **Generate slides** button.

14.  Once Copilot generates the slides, it displays them in **Slide Sorter** view. Select the **View** option on the menu bar and then select the **Normal** view.

15.  Scroll down to the end of the slide deck. The final four slides should include the newly added **Discussions: Risk, Security, and Value** topic. For each of the following three slides in this topic, you want to replace the content that Copilot generated for them with the following talking points, which you plan to use to drive discussion:

    - **Operational and business continuity risk**. Replace the section of text with the following questions:
        - Do you anticipate downtime or service interruptions?
        - Are there robust contingency and rollback plans?
        - How can we ensure seamless transition and minimal impact on customers and staff?

    - **Security, compliance, and data protection**. Replace the existing section of text with the following talking points:
        - New vulnerabilities introduced by technology changes
        - Compliance with regulatory requirements (for example, data privacy and industry standards)
        - The organization’s ability to detect, respond to, and recover from incidents

    - **Budget, value, and delivery confidence**. Replace the existing section of text with the following talking points:
        - Cost overruns and hidden expenses
        - Delays and missed milestones
        - Clear, measurable outcomes and ROI
