# Exercise 2: Transform feature launches and adoption using Microsoft 365 Copilot
---
Microsoft 365 Copilot is transforming how IT professionals plan, communicate, and measure technology adoption across their organizations. For IT teams, successful adoption isn’t just about deploying new tools—it’s about ensuring employees understand, embrace, and actively use them. Copilot can streamline every step of that process by helping IT professionals quickly discover upcoming Microsoft 365 features, create clear and engaging communications for end users, and develop practical resources such as announcements, best-practice guides, and training materials.

### Scenario

As the IT Manager at VanArsdel, Ltd., a 2,500-employee engineering and manufacturing company operating across three regions, you play a key role in helping the organization stay productive, connected, and secure. VanArsdel’s leadership recently announced a company-wide initiative to accelerate Microsoft 365 feature adoption. It wants to ensure that employees not only have access to new tools, but also understand how to use them effectively to improve collaboration and streamline daily work.

The company is preparing to roll out several new Microsoft 365 features over the next quarter, from AI-powered meeting summaries to enhanced file collaboration and security updates. However, past launches at VanArsel showed that technical readiness alone isn’t enough. The company learned the hard way that without clear communication, engaging education, and active feedback loops, adoption can stall and user frustration can rise.

To prevent a repeat of past failures, the CIO issued a directive for IT to lead a “90-Day Feature Awareness Campaign” designed to drive adoption and minimize confusion. The campaign must combine clear communication, data-driven insights, and user-friendly resources that empower employees to embrace the new tools with confidence. Your goal is to use Microsoft 365 Copilot to help you plan, communicate, and measure the effect of this initiative—turning what used to be weeks of manual effort into hours of streamlined, AI-assisted work.

Throughout this exercise, you plan to use the following Microsoft 365 Copilot features to guide the campaign from research to analysis:

- Copilot Chat to research and summarize the top eight upcoming Microsoft 365 features most relevant to VanArsdel users. Y

- Copilot in Viva Engage to create an engaging announcement post that builds awareness and excitement about the new features, along with a Viva community where employees can share questions, ideas, and feedback.

- Copilot Chat to generate a “10 Best Practice Tips” cheat sheet that provides clear, friendly, and actionable advice to help employees confidently use the new features from day one.

- The Surveys agent to design a feedback survey to track early adoption progress, identify blockers, and understand user sentiment during the first rollout phase.

- The Analyst agent to examine real survey results, visualize adoption trends, and generate executive insights for the CIO.


In this exercise, you create a complete, data-informed feature adoption campaign—from planning and communication to feedback and analytics—all powered by Microsoft 365 Copilot. You experience firsthand how Copilot can help IT professionals transform complex rollout processes into clear, engaging, and measurable success stories.
