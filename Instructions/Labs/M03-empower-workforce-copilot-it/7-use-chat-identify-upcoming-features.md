# Exercise 2, Task 1: Use Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat to identify upcoming Microsoft 365 features
---
In preparation for VanArsdel’s upcoming IT leadership meeting, you must create a summary of upcoming Microsoft 365 features that might affect users in the next quarter. You need this information quickly so that your IT team can plan communication and support strategies. Your goal is to identify and summarize the most relevant new features that can affect VanArsdel’s end users within the next 90 days, with notes on potential IT actions.

Historically, this process required your team to review blogs and admin center updates, consolidate findings, assess each feature’s implications for end users, evaluate its operational effect on IT, and prioritize the eight most significant items for presentation. Now, instead of spending hours completing this process, you plan to use Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat to gather and summarize what’s coming—all in about a minute, showcasing the dramatic time savings Copilot delivers.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  In your Microsoft Edge browser, sign in to the **Microsoft 365** home page **(https://www.microsoft365.com)**. Since the scenario involves finding future features that are published by Microsoft and not stored in VanArsdel’s tenant, select the **Web** option rather than the **Work** option.

2.  Copy and paste in the following prompt that asks Copilot to summarize the upcoming Microsoft 365 features:
  
   > [!NOTE]
   > For this first prompt, we’ve provided the text so you can see what an effective prompt looks like when it incorporates the four key elements discussed in the Introduction unit. You must write all remaining prompts in this exercise, but in doing so, you can use this prompt as a model to emulate.

   **I'm the IT Manager at VanArsdel, Ltd. Summarize the Microsoft 365 features likely to be released or generally available by Microsoft in the next 90 days that are most relevant to end users (such as collaboration, security, Teams, Outlook, SharePoint, Viva, and so on). Please list each feature along with the following information: a one-line description, why it matters for a non-technical end user, and any recommended action for IT (for example, communication, training, and change to tenant settings). Provide the result as a short bullet list (no more than 8 items).**

3.  Review Copilot’s response. If it returns sources, verify a couple of them to ensure they're valid. If it returns ambiguous items, ask a clarifying follow-up question in the Chat.

4.  At the end of the response, select the **Copy response** icon.

5.  In the **Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat** window, select the **Apps** icon in the navigation pane. In the **Apps** menu that appears, select **Word**.

6.  In **Word for the web**, create a blank document and then paste in the copied response. When you copy and paste a Copilot Chat response, it typically includes extraneous chat content at the beginning and end of the content. After you paste in the copied response, delete any extraneous text that was pasted in as well. Tag or highlight items you want to prioritize for communications.

7.  In the Word document, select the **Copilot** option on the **Home** tab. In the Copilot chat pane, ask Copilot for two more requests: 1) Write a short executive summary based on the bullet list, and 2) for each of the features previously identified, provide a one-sentence risk or opportunity for each item. Position your cursor at the end of the document and then select the **Add to doc (+)** icon.

8.  You plan to use this document in a later task, so make note of the file name that appears above the menu bar.
