# Exercise 2, Task 3: Use Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat to create best practice tips
---
Now that the announcement post is ready, you want to help users smoothly adopt these features. To do so, you want to create a cheat sheet that VanArsdel's end users can share during training sessions. You also want to include this cheat sheet with all onboarding materials.

Rather than starting from scratch, you plan to ask Copilot Chat to generate these practical, easy-to-read tips based on the same features you researched earlier. Your goal is to produce 10 short, actionable best-practice tips that help employees start using the new Microsoft 365 features with confidence.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  In your Microsoft Edge browser, go to the **Microsoft 365** home page **(https://www.office.com)**. Since the scenario involves implementing future features that are published by Microsoft and not stored in VanArsdel’s tenant, select the **Web** option rather than the **Work** option.

2.  In the Copilot Chat prompt, attach the document from Task 1 that contains the Microsoft 365 feature list. Then ask Copilot to create a cheat sheet titled **10 Best Practice Tips**. It should include 10 concise best-practice tips for adopting the new Microsoft 365 features that are listed in the attached document. Each tip should include a short sentence that describes what the tip is, followed by a short explanation (maximum of 25 words) that describes why the tip is important to users. 

3.  Review the cheat sheet that Copilot generated. Submit any suggested Copilot prompts that interest you. Feel free to enhance this document however you wish.

4.  Ask Copilot to output the tips in different formats. For example:
    - One-page cheat sheet (Word)
    - A version for email (short subject line + 5 bullets)


5.  Save the cheat sheet and export it to a PDF.
