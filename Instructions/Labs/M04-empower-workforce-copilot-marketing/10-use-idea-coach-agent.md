# Exercise 2, Task 3: Use Copilot’s Idea Coach agent to generate creative campaign concepts
---
Now that you finished analyzing the market data and reviewing the performance of Mystic Spice Premium Chai Tea, you want to develop ideas for a new seasonal marketing campaign to build on the brand’s growing success. The campaign should target health-conscious, experience-driven consumers who value comfort, wellness, and authenticity, which are the core brand pillars of Mystic Spice Premium Chai Tea.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  Open **Microsoft 365** and in the navigation pane, under the **Agents** section, select **All agents**. In the **Agent Store**, under the **Your agents** section, select **See more**. In the expanded list of **Your agents**, select **Idea Coach**.

2.  In the **Idea Coach** agent, attach the **Mystic Spice Premium Chai Tea product description.docx** file that you downloaded in Task 1 and stored in your OneDrive. Then ask the Idea Coach agent to review the attached product description file and generate 3–5 marketing campaign ideas that align with the warm, comforting identity of Mystic Spice Premium Chai Tea.

3.  Review the results. Select one of the campaign ideas that appeals to you. You plan to use this campaign idea through the rest of this task and in the next one.

4.  Now that you selected the campaign idea of your choice, ask the Idea Coach agent to expand on it  by providing suggestions for key messages, taglines, and promotional activities (for example, influencer collaborations, social media themes, in-store experiences).

5.  Review the results. While they're a good starting point, ask the agent to refine the ideas for your selected campaign for the Latin America market and for the Gen Z vs. professionals demographic.

6.  Review the results. Now ask the Idea Coach for any other ideas on how Contoso can improve this campaign.

7.  Review the suggested prompts the agent displayed at the end of this last response. Select and submit a prompt that’s of interest to you.

8.  Repeat the prior step for another suggested prompt.

9.  When you’re satisfied with the final results, ask the Idea Coach if it can combine all the ideas that it provided in this chat into a Word document.

10. Review the agent’s response. During our testing, the agent indicated that it couldn’t generate a Word document directly, but it could provide a fully formatted, copy-paste-ready version of all the ideas and plans we discussed so that we could easily insert it into Word. It then displayed all the results from this chat conversation in one complete result. 
<br/><br/>If you experienced the same results, scroll to the end of the response, select the **Copy response** icon, open a blank Word document, and paste in the copied text. Review the inserted content and remove any extraneous text from your conversation that appears at the start and end of the document. Save the file to your OneDrive as **Mystic Spice Premium Chai Tea campaign concepts.docx**.

11. You plan to use the **Mystic Spice Premium Chai Tea campaign concepts.docx** document in the next task.
