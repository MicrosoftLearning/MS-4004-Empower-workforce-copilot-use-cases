# Exercise 2, Task 3: Use Copilot’s Idea Coach agent to generate creative campaign concepts
---
Now that you finished analyzing the market data and reviewing the performance of Mystic Spice Premium Chai Tea, you want to develop ideas for a new seasonal marketing campaign to build on the brand’s growing success. The campaign should target health-conscious, experience-driven consumers who value comfort, wellness, and authenticity, which are the core brand pillars of Mystic Spice Premium Chai Tea.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  Open **Microsoft 365** and in the navigation pane, under the **Agents** section, select **All agents**. In the **Agent Store**, under the **Your agents** section, select **See more**. In the expanded list of **Your agents**, select **Idea Coach**.

2.  In the **Idea Coach** agent, attach the **Mystic Spice Premium Chai Tea product description.docx** file that you downloaded in Task 1 and stored in your OneDrive. Then ask the Idea Coach agent to review the attached product description file and generate 3–5 marketing campaign ideas that align with the warm, comforting identity of Mystic Spice Premium Chai Tea.

3.  Review the campaign ideas and then select one that appeals to you. You will use this campaign idea through the rest of this task and in the next one.

4.  Once you select a campaign idea, ask the Idea Coach agent to expand on this campaign idea with suggestions for key messages, taglines, and promotional activities (for example, influencer collaborations, social media themes, in-store experiences).

5.  Your ultimate goal is to create a Word document that contains not only this response, but various other ideas that you’re going to ask Idea Coach to generate regarding your selected campaign in the upcoming steps. While creating documents is outside the role of the Idea Coach, it does provide you with the ability to edit its responses in **Pages**, which can then be saved in a Word document, PowerPoint, or PDF.  
    <br/>Since you want to eventually save this content to a Word document, select the **Edit in Pages** icon that appears at the end of the response.

6.  When you select the **Edit in Pages** icon, Copilot displays two panes—one that displays the **Idea Coach** agent and your current chat, and another that displays the **Pages** form and the content that was copied from your chat.  
    <br/>Review the content in the **Pages** form. Delete any extraneous text that was copied and pasted with the results (see the start and end of the content). Feel free to make any changes to the headings or any other content on the form.

7.  In the **Idea Coach** chat pane, ask it to refine the ideas for your selected campaign for the Latin America market and for the Gen Z vs. professionals demographic.

8.  Review the response. Since you want to include this response with the existing content in the Pages form, select the **Add to page (+)** icon that appears at the end of the agent’s response. Scroll to the bottom of the **Pages** form and verify the content was inserted. Delete any extraneous text that was copied and pasted with the content (see the start and end of the content that was pasted in the Pages form).

9.  Review the suggested prompts the agent displayed at the end of this last response. Select and submit a prompt that’s of interest to you.

    > [!CAUTION]
    > Be wary of prompts that ask you to generate content for a foreign language. The agent might return that response and all subsequent responses in that language. If the agent continues to generate responses in that language, you must reset the chat by asking it to display its responses in your preferred language.
    
    If none of the prompts interest you, ask the agent to generate more suggested prompts, in which case you must select a prompt and copy and paste it in the prompt field.
    
10.  Add this response to the **Pages** form, just as you did with the prior response.

11.  You’re now ready to save this Pages content to a Word document. On the **Pages** pane, select the **Create** button that appears at the top of the pane. In the menu that appears, select **Document**. This option instructs the agent to generate a draft of the content for Microsoft Word.

12.  Once the agent finishes generating the draft, select the **Open Word** button that appears. Doing so opens a new browser tab that contains a document in **Word for the web**. The content from the **Pages** form should appear in the Word document. Save the document to your OneDrive as **Mystic Spice Premium Chai Tea campaign concepts.docx**.

13.  You plan to use the **Mystic Spice Premium Chai Tea campaign concepts** document in the next task.
