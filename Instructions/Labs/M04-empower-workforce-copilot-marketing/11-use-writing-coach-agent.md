# Exercise 2, Task 4: Use Copilot’s Writing Coach agent to draft promotional campaign announcements
---
In the prior task, you selected a campaign idea for Mystic Spice Premium Chai Tea. You then had the Idea Coach agent help expand on this idea with suggestions for key messages, taglines, and promotional activities, which you saved in the **Mystic Spice Premium Chai Tea campaign concepts** document.

It’s now time to bring your campaign to life! Your goal is to create a short, engaging promotional announcements for a digital ad or social media post announcing the campaign launch. The announcement should be based in part on the campaign concepts captured in the **Mystic Spice Premium Chai Tea campaign concepts** document.

You plan to use Copilot’s Writing Coach agent to draft this promotional announcement. It should capture the public’s attention, reflect the campaign’s theme and concepts, and encourage audience participation. You want to keep the tone warm, inviting, and aligned with Mystic Spice’s comforting identity. Ensure the message is concise and optimized for digital platforms.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  Open **Microsoft 365** and in the navigation pane, under the **Agents** section, select **All agents**. In the **Agent Store**, under the **Your agents** section, select **See more**. In the expanded list of **Your agents**, select **Writing Coach**.

2.  In the **Writing Coach** agent, attach the **Mystic Spice Premium Chai Tea campaign concepts** file that you created in the prior task and stored in your OneDrive. Ask the Writing Coach agent to draft a short promotional message for a social media post or an online banner ad. The message should be based in part on the concepts outlined in the attached document.

3.  Review the promotional message. Ask the Writing Coach to for suggestions on how to improve it for tone, clarity, and engagement level.

4.  Review the suggested edits and the improved version provided by the agent. Tell the agent you like this improved version, but then ask how it can make the message more emotionally resonant or better aligned with the brand voice.

5.  Review the suggested edits and the improved version provided by the agent. Tell the agent you like this revised, emotionally resonant version, and then ask it to create three distinct versions of this message - luxury-focused, wellness-focused, and cultural storytelling.

6.  Review the results. Now ask the agent to create a carousel concept with these three themes for social media. A carousel concept refers to a social media format that' commonly used on platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn. Within a carousel concept, multiple images or cards are grouped into a single post that users can swipe through horizontally.

7.  Review the results. While they look good, ask the agent to write full captions for each slide and optimize the captions for Instagram and Facebook.

8.  Review the results. Ask the agent to design the visual layout ideas for each slide, including color palette, imagery, and typography suggestions.

9.  Review the results. Finally, ask the agent to suggest animation ideas for a dynamic carousel experience.


The purpose of this task was to expose you to some of the ways in which the Writing Coach can assist marketers. The agent’s core role obviously focuses on writing, such as helping with tone, clarity, structure, and creativity. However, when marketing professionals work on social media content, writing is often combined with visual storytelling because the effectiveness of the message depends on both words and design. So, while the Writing Coach's primary expertise is in crafting compelling text, it can also suggest visual and animation ideas to ensure the marketer’s written message shines in the context in which it appears, such as Instagram carousels and banner ads.
