---
Marketing today requires not just creativity, but speed, insight, and data-driven decision-making. Microsoft 365 Copilot empowers Marketing professionals to meet these demands by serving as a trusted partner across their daily workflow: from gathering and synthesizing market intelligence, to analyzing trends, generating strategic recommendations, drafting marketing briefs, and building actionable campaign plans.

In this hands-on experience, you step into the role of a Marketing professional at Relecloud, a global innovator in smart workspace technology. Relecloud is preparing to launch WorkSmart 360, a next-generation platform that uses AI and IoT technology to optimize office environments for energy efficiency and employee productivity. To ensure a successful launch, the Marketing team must quickly understand the market landscape, identify key trends, and translate insights into a compelling campaign strategy.

Microsoft 365 Copilot helps Marketing departments achieve exactly that. With its integrated tools across Copilot Studio, the prebuilt Analyst agent, and Microsoft 365 applications like Word and Planner, Copilot enables marketers to:

- **Accelerate market research** by gathering and synthesizing data from web sources, social media, and competitor reports.
