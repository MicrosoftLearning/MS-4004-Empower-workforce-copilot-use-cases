# Exercise 1, Task 2: Use the Market Research Agent to synthesize market intelligence
---
Relecloud is gearing up to launch its flagship solution, WorkSmart 360, designed for the commercial office market. This all-in-one platform optimizes workspace efficiency by monitoring space utilization, dynamically adjusting lighting and temperature, and delivering actionable analytics. In a crowded and competitive market, the challenge is to craft a campaign that not only showcases the platform’s comprehensive capabilities but also positions Relecloud as the leader in smart workplace innovation.

In this task, you continue in your role as a Senior Marketing Strategist for Relecloud. Now that you created the Market Research Agent in Microsoft 365 Copilot, you want to use it to collect and synthesize comprehensive market insights for smart workspace products in the commercial office market. Once you gather and synthesize this market intelligence, you then plan to use Copilot’s prebuilt Analyst agent to interpret the data and generate strategic Marketing recommendations in Task 3.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  In your Microsoft Edge browser, you should have a tab open from the prior task that displays the **Market Research Agent**. If not, open Microsoft 365 and select the **Market Research Agent** to open it.

2.  In the **Market Research Agent**, the first three suggested prompts appear. Select the prompt titled **Market insights report** if it appears; otherwise, select the **Show more** option that appears below the three prompts and then select the **Market insights report** from the full list of prompts. Doing so displays the prompt message in the prompt field.

3.  In the prompt message, replace **{Product Category}** with **Smart workspace products in the commercial office market**, and then submit the prompt.

4.  Review the report. If you receive a message from the agent at the start of the report that indicates it can’t create a downloadable file, then you must copy and paste the content into a Word document once you finalize the report (the final step in this task).

5.  Scroll to the end of the report, where the agent should display several suggested prompts. These prompts typically suggest more content that it can add to the report to enhance it even further. Select one of the prompts that interests you or enter your own custom prompt.

6.  Review the results. Verify the content that you requested appears in the report. Also note the updated list of suggested prompts. Continue updating the report using any of the suggested prompts (or enter your own custom prompts) until you’re satisfied with the report.

7.  Once you feel the report is complete, you should save it as **Market Insights Report – Smart Workspaces.docx** to your OneDrive so that you can access it in the next task. 

    - When the report was initially generated, if the agent displayed a message indicating that it couldn’t create a downloadable file, then select the **Copy response** icon that appears below your final report update. Then open a blank Word document, paste in the copied text, remove any extraneous conversational text that was included (see the start and end of the copied text), and then save the file to your OneDrive. 
    
    - However, if the agent was able to create a downloadable file, then select the link to the file to download it and then save the file to your OneDrive. 


You’re now ready to use Copilot’s Analys agent to interpret the report that you created and generate strategic recommendations.
