# Analyze a market trend spreadsheet using Microsoft 365 Copilot in Excel
---
Marketing professionals can use Microsoft 365 Copilot in Excel to analyze their data and gain insight into their business. Copilot in Excel is a powerful tool that can help Marketing professionals create, edit, understand, and visualize their data with ease.

For example, they can use Copilot in Excel to analyze quarterly business results, summarize key trends, apply color coding to tables, create models, scenarios, filter and sort, and add charts at the click of a mouse. Copilot's AI-powered capabilities can help Marketing professionals save time and effort by automating repetitive tasks and providing valuable insights that can help them make informed decisions. By using Copilot in Excel, they can focus on what matters most - their business goals and objectives.

Copilot in Excel is an invaluable tool in the Marketing professional's toolbox. It provides a wealth of benefits, including:

- **Highlight, filter, and sort data**. Copilot in Excel can help Marketing professionals quickly identify and organize data by highlighting, filtering, and sorting it. For example, a Marketing professional can use Copilot to filter out irrelevant data from a large data set, such as customer demographics, and focus on the data that is most relevant to their marketing goals. Copilot works with existing data in your workbook. It can reorganize, summarize, or model it—but it doesn’t generate random new datasets entirely from scratch without context.
- **Generate formula column suggestions for complex calculations**. Copilot in Excel can help Marketing professionals generate formula column suggestions for complex calculations, such as calculating the return on investment (ROI) of their marketing campaigns. For instance, a Marketing professional can use Copilot to calculate the ROI of their email marketing campaign by dividing the revenue generated during the campaign by the cost of the campaign. Copilot can assist with formulas and suggest fixes, but it doesn’t automatically correct all errors without guidance. User input is still needed to ensure accuracy and intent.
- **Assist with data analysis, comprehension, and visualization**. Copilot in Excel can help Marketing professionals analyze data trends, comprehend and visualize their data, and explain insights in natural language. It’s designed to help users interpret complex data without needing to manually build charts or pivot tables. For example, a Marketing professional can use Copilot to identify trends in their sales data and use these insights to make informed decisions about their marketing strategies.

When you use Copilot in Excel, your data needs to be formatted in either an Excel table or in a regular range of cells (nontable format). For best results, especially with complex tasks like summarizing data, generating insights, or using advanced Excel functions, it's recommended to work with data in a table format. Doing so ensures that Copilot can reference and work with your data more efficiently. You can quickly turn a range of cells into an Excel table by following these steps:

1. Select the cell or the range in the data.
1. Select **Home** > **Format as Table**.
1. In the **Format as Table** dialog box, select the checkbox next to **My table has headers** if you want the first row of the range to be the header row.
1. Select **OK**.

In this exercise, you use Copilot in Excel to analyze a market trend spreadsheet that already has an Excel table defined. This exercise examines many of Copilot's prebuilt functions and prompts.

### Exercise

As the Director of Marketing for Contoso Beverage, a division of Contoso, Ltd., you received a market trend spreadsheet showing monthly activity for Contoso's Chai Tea product in the past year. You want to use the features of Copilot in Excel to analyze the report and provide detailed analysis of the monthly marketing trends. In this exercise, you review the various predefined prompts and features that Copilot in Excel provides.

Perform the following steps to analyze the market trend spreadsheet using Copilot in Excel:

1. In the prior exercise, you downloaded a copy of the Contoso Chai Tea market trends report. In this exercise, you download an Excel spreadsheet version of this report. Select the following link to download a copy of the [**Contoso Chai Tea market trends**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2268822) spreadsheet.
1. Once the download is complete, open **File Explorer** and move the file from your **Downloads** folder to your **Microsoft - OneDrive** folder.
1. In this exercise, you access the spreadsheet from the Most Recently Used (MRU) file list. To get the files to appear in the MRU list, open and close the file in your **Microsoft - OneDrive** folder.
1. If you have a Microsoft 365 tab open in your Microsoft Edge browser, then select it now; otherwise, open a new tab and enter the following URL: [**https://www.office.com**](https://www.office.com)
1. On the **Microsoft 365** home page, select the **Excel** icon if it appears in the navigation pane. Otherwise, select **Apps** in the navigation pane, and then on the **Apps** page, select **Excel**. 
1. In **Excel**, on the **File** page, select **Contoso Chai Tea market trends.xlsx** from the file list.
1. With the spreadsheet open in **Excel**, select the **Copilot** option on the right side of the ribbon (if the ribbon isn't displayed, hover over the **Home** tab). Doing so opens the **Copilot** pane. 
1. In the **Copilot** pane that appears, several predefined prompts are available for you to choose from. If a prompt appears that says **Show data insights**, then select it now. If this prompt doesn't appear, then select **More examples**, which appears below the suggested prompts. Each time you select **More examples**, a new set of prompts appears. If **Show data insights** appears in the list of prompts, then select it. Otherwise, select **More examples** a few times, and if **Show data insights** doesn't appear in the list of suggested prompts, then enter the following prompt yourself and select the **Send** icon: **Show a data insight**.
1. Note the graph that Copilot generated. During our testing, Copilot created a few different charts. Sometimes it was the **Artisanal Chai Sales (units)**; other times it created a bar chart of the **Social Media Engagement (views) by Month**. What type of chart did Copilot create for you? 
1. Note that Copilot didn't include the full legend for the chart, given the space limitations in the **Copilot** pane. To see the pivot table and full chart that Copilot created, select the **+Add to a new sheet** button, which appears below the chart.
1. Select **Sheet 2**. Review the new data sheet that Copilot created. Copilot included both the graph and the column of data from the spreadsheet that was the basis of this graph. 
1. To request another data insight or submit a prompt of your own, you must be back on the data sheet containing the spreadsheet. Select **Sheet 1**, which returns you back to the Excel table. 
1. Note the predefined prompts that appear above the prompt field. Select the **Refresh** button to display another set of prompts. Feel free to select any of the predefined prompts that are of interest to you. See how Copilot responds. 
1. You now want to see what type of data analysis Copilot might recommend. A predefined prompt may appear that says, "**Show a suggestion for a formula column**." "Formula column" generally refers to a column where you would apply a formula to perform calculations. If you select this prompt, it triggers Copilot to analyze your data and suggest a possible formula or calculation that could be useful for your dataset. Doing so is especially helpful in the context of columns that require formulas to provide more insights or automate calculations. Basically, Copilot suggests ways to automate or enhance your work with formulas to make the data analysis faster and more efficient. If you don't see a prompt that says, "**Show a suggestion for a formula column,**" then select the **Refresh** button a couple of times. If this prompt doesn't appear after a few refresh attempts, then enter the following prompt: **Show a suggestion for a formula column**. 

   Note the suggestion that Copilot provides. In the suggestion that you received, select the **Show explanation** drop-down arrow. Review Copilot's explanation that describes the calculation. When you finish reviewing the formula suggestion, select the **+Insert column** button to insert the column into your Excel table.

1. Note how Copilot added the column of data to the end of your Excel table in **Sheet 1**. This feature intrigues you, so you now want to see what other formula suggestions it provides. If a predefined prompt appears that says, "**Show a suggestion for a formula column**", then select it now. If this predefined prompt doesn't appear, then enter the following prompt: **Show a suggestion for a formula column.** Note the suggestion. Select the **+Insert column** button to insert this suggested column into your Excel table.
1. The purpose of this exercise is to get a feel for the various types of predefined actions that Copilot can perform. Select the **Refresh** icon several more times as you look for an action that interests you. Select the prompt to see what Copilot does. Feel free to select other prompts. When you're done, close your Microsoft Edge browser tab.
