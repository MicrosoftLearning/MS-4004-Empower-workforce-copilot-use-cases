# Exercise 1, Task 3: Use Copilot’s Analyst agent to generate strategic recommendations
---
In the previous phase, you used the Market Research Agent to collect and synthesize comprehensive insights on the smart workspace products market. You saved this information in a report titled **Market Insights Report – Smart Workspaces.docx**. The data in this report included trends, audience behaviors, cultural shifts, competitive developments, and recommended actions. Now, it’s time to move from insight to strategy.

In this task, you plan to use Copilot’s Analyst agent to interpret the findings in the **Market Insights Report – Smart Workspaces.docx** file and translate them into strategic marketing recommendations that can guide real-world decision-making. To accomplish this goal, you plan to use the Analyst agent to:

- **Analyze the report’s insights**. Identify the most critical trends, audience behaviors, and competitive signals.

- **Prioritize opportunities**. Determine which insights have the highest potential effect on messaging, positioning, and channel strategy.

- **Develop actionable recommendations**. Create a strategic playbook that includes:
    - Messaging pillars aligned with cultural and behavioral shifts.
    - Channel mix and content formats optimized for audience consumption patterns.
    - Influencer and partnership strategies to amplify reach and credibility.
    - Risk considerations and mitigation tactics.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  Open Microsoft 365 in a new browser tab. In the list of agents in the navigation pane, select **Analyst**.

2.  In the **Analyst** agent prompt field, attach the **Market Insights Report – Smart Workspaces.docx** file that you saved to your OneDrive in the prior task.

3.  For your first deliverable, ask the Analyst agent to analyze the attached report and identify the most critical trends, audience behaviors, and competitive signals that should guide Relecloud’s marketing strategy for WorkSmart 360. Ask the agent to explain in detail why Relecloud should prioritize these items.

4.  Review the results. Select the **Copy response** icon that appears below the results. Then open a blank Word document, paste in the copied text, remove any extraneous conversational text that was included (usually at the start and end of the copied content), and then save the file to your OneDrive as **Smart Workspace Market Insights.docx**.

5.  Ask the agent to create a visual summary (infographic) of these priorities.

6.  Review the graphic. Feel free to request any changes to it. Once you're satisfied with the graphic, copy it and then paste it into the end of the Word document that you created and saved earlier. Remove any extraneous conversational text that was included.

7.  In our testing, the infographic had some issues, with text falling outside the colored boxes that it included. Ask the agent to create a one-page PDF version of this infographic to see if it appears better in that format.

8.  Select the link provided by the agent to download the PDF version of this infographic. Open the file. While you feel the graphic still leaves something to be desired, it does look better than the original version the agent generated. Save this PDF file to your OneDrive so that you can share it later with your team.

9.  For your second deliverable, you want the Analyst agent to prioritize opportunities. Ask the agent to determine which insights have the highest potential effect on messaging, positioning, and channel strategy.

10. Review the results. Copy the text and then paste it into the end of the Word document that you created earlier. Remove any extraneous conversational text that was included.

11. Since visuals are always helpful when explaining content, ask the agent to turn this ranked analysis into a visual impact matrix (Messaging vs. Positioning vs. Channel).

12. Review the graphic. Feel free to request any changes to it. Once you're satisfied with the graphic, copy it and then paste it into the end of the Word document that you created earlier. Remove any extraneous conversational text that was included.

13. For the final deliverable, ask the Analyst agent to provide a set of actionable marketing recommendations based on this marketing summary, including:
    - Messaging pillars aligned with cultural and behavioral shifts.
    - Channel mix and content formats optimized for audience consumption patterns.
    - Influencer and partnership strategies to amplify reach and credibility.
    - Risk considerations and mitigation tactics.

14. Review the results. Copy the text and then paste it into the end of the Word document that you created earlier. Remove any extraneous conversational text that was included.

15. Lastly, ask the agent to create a concise, one-page Executive Summary of this research for leadership. This document should highlight risks, opportunities, and suggested next steps.


16. Select the link provided by the agent to download the Executive Summary document.
