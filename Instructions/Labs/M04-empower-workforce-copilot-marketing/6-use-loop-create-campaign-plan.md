Now that you completed your marketing research and analysis, you’re ready to launch Relecloud’s WorkSpace 360 smart workplace solution in the commercial office market. To do so, you must begin by creating a fully integrated launch campaign plan that brings the marketing strategies to life and drives measurable results.

Your campaign must:

- Apply the insights from the **Smart Workspace Market Insights.docx** report.

- Align with Relecloud’s business objectives: increase brand awareness, generate qualified leads, and position the product as a leader in smart, sustainable workspaces.

- Be multi-channel, data-driven, and actionable.

As you considered this task, you weren’t sure whether Microsoft Loop or Planner would be the best app for this project. After doing some research, you learned that Loop would work best for structuring the campaign plan, brainstorming messaging, and outlining KPIs. Planner, on the other hand, was more appropriate for converting the phases and deliverables into tasks with owners and due dates once the plan was approved. So for this task, you plan to use Copilot in Loop to create the WorkSpace 360 launch campaign plan.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  In your Microsoft Edge browser, go to the **Microsoft 365** home page, select **Apps** in the navigation pane, and then select **Loop** from the **Apps** menu.

2.  In **Loop for the web**, create a new workspace titled **WorkSpace 360 Launch Campaign Plan**.

3.  You plan to create the following pages under this Loop workspace (in this order):
    - Campaign objectives
    - Target audience and segmentation
    - Messaging pillars
    - Channels and content formats
    - Campaign components
    - Timeline and phases
    - KPIs and measurement plan
    - Budget allocation
    - Risk assessment and mitigation

    To begin, change the current title of the first page from **Untitled** to **Campaign objectives**.

4.  Open the **Copilot** pane for this page.

5.  Ask Copilot to review the attached **Smart Workspace Market Insights.docx** file and identify the primary goals for this campaign (for example, awareness, engagement, lead generation). Translate these goals into SMART objectives (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound). For example, “Increase LinkedIn engagement by 30% in 90 days.” Select the plus sign (+) icon in the prompt field and attach the **Smart Workspace Market Insights.docx** file.

6.  Review the results and then select the **Copy** icon that appears below the content. Paste the copied results into your Loop page. Delete any extraneous text that was copied and pasted along with the results (see the start and end of the content).

7.  Repeat the previous steps to add the remaining pages defined in step 3. For each page, attach the **Smart Workspace Market Insights.docx** file to the Copilot prompt and ask Copilot to generate the following information based on the market research in the file (copy and paste this bulleted list into your prompt, then copy this prompt to reuse it for each new page request):  

    - **Target audience and segmentation**. Use insights from the report to define key personas (for example, Facilities Managers, HR Directors, Gen Z professionals, and so on). Then segment by industry, company size, and decision-making role.

    - **Messaging pillars**. Develop 3–4 core messages based on cultural shifts and audience pain points, such as “Smart, Sustainable, Human-Centric Workspaces.” Include value propositions and proof points (AI personalization, eco-friendly design, well-being integration).

    - **Channels and content formats**. Map channels to audience behaviors. For example, “LinkedIn: Thought leadership & ROI education,” “TikTok/Instagram: Influencer-led short-form demos,” and “YouTube: Deep-dive product explainers.” Define content types, such as video reels, carousel posts, blog articles, and email nurture sequences.

    - **Campaign components**. Create a unifying theme and tagline, such as “Work Smarter. Live Greener.” List required assets, such as videos, infographics, and landing pages. Identify influencer categories, such as tech experts and workplace wellness advocates.

    - **Timeline and phases**. Build a timeline that includes the following phases: Phase 1 (Awareness): Influencer videos + LinkedIn thought leadership; Phase 2 (Consideration): ROI-focused micro-learning content; Phase 3 (Conversion): Email campaigns + retargeting ads. Assign start and end dates and responsible roles to each phase.

    - **KPIs and measurement plan**. For each phase in the timeline, define KPIs and a measurement plan. Phase 1 (Awareness): Impressions, engagement rate; Phase 2 (Consideration): Click-through rate, time on page; Phase 3 (Conversion): Leads generated, cost per acquisition. Include recommended tracking tools, such as Google Analytics and LinkedIn Insights.

    - **Budget allocation**. Estimate the spend per channel and asset. Prioritize high-impact channels based on insights, such as video-first and influencer-driven.

    - **Risk assessment and mitigation**. Identify potential risks, such as influencer credibility and budget overruns. Suggest mitigation strategies, such as vet influencers and set contingency budget.

This exercise demonstrated how Copilot in Loop can assist Marketing teams in streamlining execution. Copilot enabled you to turn recommendations into campaign plans and task lists that can keep teams aligned and on schedule.
