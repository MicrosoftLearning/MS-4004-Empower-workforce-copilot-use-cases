# Exercise 2, Task 1: Use Copilot in Word to consolidate multiple market reports
---
Contoso's Latin America (LATAM) product manager provided you with three market reports involving the company's Mystic Spice Premium Chai Tea beverage. However, you’re finding it difficult to analyze the information, since you’re constantly jumping back and forth between documents.

You decide to use Copilot in Word to combine the reports into a single LATAM Market Analysis report for Mystic Spice Premium Chai Tea. Once Copilot creates this report, you want to review it and possibly update it with other information that Copilot can find on the Chai Tea market in Latin America.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  Select the following links to download the Mystic Spice Premium Chai Tea market reports provided by Contoso’s LATAM Product Manager:
    - [**Mystic Spice Premium Chai Tea product description.docx**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2347617)
    - [**Contoso Chai Tea market trends.docx**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2269122)
    - [**Promotion Plan for Chai Tea in Latin America.docx**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2269126)

2.  Once the downloads are complete, store the files in your OneDrive folder.

3.  In your Microsoft Edge browser, sign in to the **Microsoft 365** home page **(https://www.microsoft365.com)**, select **Apps** in the navigation pane, and then select **Word** from the **Apps** menu.

4.  In **Word for the web**, open a blank document. In the Copilot window that appears at the top of the blank document, attach the three market report documents from your OneDrive account.

5.  Then ask Copilot to combine the attached files to create a single report that describes the product, analyzes the market trend for it, and includes a promotion plan for Latin America. Submit the following prompt:
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > For this first prompt, we’ve provided the text so you can see what an effective prompt looks like when it incorporates the four key elements discussed in the Introduction unit. You must write all remaining prompts in this exercise, but in doing so, you can use this prompt as a model to emulate.

    **I’m the Latin America Marketing Director for Contoso Beverage, working on a new promotional campaign for our company’s Mystic Spice Premium Chai Tea beverage. I’ve received three separate market reports for this product, but I need a single, cohesive analysis to guide our marketing strategy. Please combine the attached reports into one unified LATAM Market Analysis report for Mystic Spice Premium Chai Tea. Use the content from the three attached market reports as your main sources. You may also supplement with relevant, credible insights you can find about the Chai Tea market in Latin America, including consumer preferences and emerging trends. Create a professional, well-organized report that includes the following sections: 1) Product Overview – Describe Mystic Spice Premium Chai Tea and its unique qualities. 2) Market Analysis – Summarize key insights and trends for the Chai Tea market in Latin America. 3) Promotion Plan – Recommend strategies or promotional ideas tailored to the region. Format the report with clear headings, concise paragraphs, and a brief executive summary at the beginning.**

6.  After reviewing this first draft of the LATAM Market Analysis report, you recognize that it's missing some critical information. You would like to see it include a section that analyzes competitor products. Ask Copilot to add a section to the report titled Competitive Analysis, which should analyze the current competition in the Latin American Chai Tea market. This section should compare key players in the industry, such as established brands and emerging startups. Since Copilot sometimes just creates a new draft that just contains the requested section, ask it to display the entire report with the new section included.

7.  Note in the Copilot prompt window that it indicates this version is draft 2 of 2. After reviewing this second draft of the report that contains the new Competitive Analysis section, you realize that this new section is missing some key information about your competitors. Ask Copilot to update the Competitive Analysis section to ensure that it includes each competitors’ market share, product offerings, pricing strategies, distribution channels, and any key differentiators. Ask it to include any other information related to these competitors, such as trends or shifts in consumer preferences that could affect the competitive landscape. Ask it to display the entire report along with the updated Competitive Analysis section.

8.  Review the results of this latest prompt, which are displayed in draft 3 of 3. Upon doing so, it dawns on you that the report is missing a key piece of information – Distribution Channels. Ask Copilot to add a section titled Distribution Channels. This section should analyze the retailers, wholesalers, and distributors used to sell Chai Tea in Latin America. Ask it to display the entire report along with the Distribution Channels section.

9.  Review the results of this latest prompt, which are displayed in draft 4 of 4. If you preferred one of the earlier drafts, you could select the back arrow to go back to one of the earlier drafts and then save that draft as your actual Word document. But in this instance, you’re satisfied with the final draft. So, on draft 4 of 4, select the **Keep it** button to convert this final Copilot draft to a Word document.

10.  Review the Word document that was generated. If you want to make any manual changes, you can do so now. Once you're satisfied with it, save the document to your OneDrive folder as **LATAM Market Analysis report** and then close the report.
