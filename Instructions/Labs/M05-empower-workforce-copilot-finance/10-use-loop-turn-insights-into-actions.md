Before presenting the PowerPoint presentation titled **Smart Sensor contract comparison - Finance** to Finance leadership, you want to gather diverse perspectives from the Finance team, especially from those members with procurement and legal experience. You plan to use Copilot in Microsoft Loop to review your draft presentation and turn its insights involving negotiation strategy, risk mitigation ideas, and communication framing into actionable, collaborative content.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  In your Microsoft Edge browser, go to the **Microsoft 365** home page, select **Apps** in the navigation pane, and then select **Loop** from the **Apps** menu.

2.  In **Loop for the web**, create a new workspace titled **Adatum/Contoso contract comparison**.

3.  You plan to create three new pages under this Loop workspace – one for negotiation strategy, another for risk mitigation ideas, and a third for communication framing. To begin, change the current title of the first page from **Untitled** to **Negotiation Strategy**.

4.  Open the Copilot pane.

5.  Ask Copilot to review the attached **Smart Sensor contract comparison – Finance.pptx** file and turn its negotiation recommendations into a structured Loop table with columns like Action, Priority, Owner, and Deadline. Attach the file by entering a forward slash and then selecting the **Smart Sensor contract comparison – Finance.pptx** file from the **Files** tab.

6.  Review the table results and then select the **Copy** icon that appears below the table. Paste the copied results into your Loop page. Delete any extraneous text that was copied and pasted along with the table.

7.  Next, add a new page under your **Adatum/Contoso contract comparison** workspace. Change the title of the page from **Untitled** to **Risk mitigation ideas**.

8.  Open the Copilot pane and ask Copilot to review the attached **Smart Sensor contract comparison – Finance.pptx** file and turn the risk mitigation ideas into a checklist with status fields for tracking.

9.  Review the results and then copy and paste the content into your Loop page. Delete any extraneous text that was copied and pasted along with the ideas.

10. Finally, add a new page under your **Adatum/Contoso contract comparison** workspace. Change the title of the page from **Untitled** to **Communication plan**.

11. Open the Copilot pane and ask Copilot to review the attached **Smart Sensor contract comparison – Finance.pptx** file and draft a communication plan for sharing its recommendations with stakeholders, including timeline and channels.

12. Review the results and then copy and paste the content into your Loop page. Delete any extraneous text that was copied and pasted along with the communication plan.

13. In the next task, you create an email for your Finance colleagues that includes a link to the Loop workspace that you just created. Keep the Loop workspace open so that you can copy its link.
