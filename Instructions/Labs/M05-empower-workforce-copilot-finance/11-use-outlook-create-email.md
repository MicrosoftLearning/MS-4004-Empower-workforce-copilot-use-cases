# Exercise 2, Task 4: Use Copilot in Outlook to create an email that requests feedback
---
You’re finalizing your materials and need quick feedback from your Finance colleagues. To do so, you plan to use Copilot in Outlook to create a short, polished email that motivates timely collaboration and streamlines the review process. You want the email to sound professional and urgent but remain collaborative and positive. It should solicit feedback on your presentation, embed the Loop component that you created in the prior task for collaboration, and strike a direct, concise tone while conveying urgency.

This exercise helps you become familiar with Copilot’s draft process in Outlook by generating multiple email versions. You learn how to create, review, and compare different drafts so you can select the one that best fits your tone and purpose.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  In your Microsoft Edge browser, go to the **Microsoft 365** home page, select **Apps** in the navigation pane, and then select **Outlook** from the **Apps** menu.

2.  In **Outlook on the web**, create a new email.

3.  Use **Copilot in Outlook** to draft the email message. In the body of the message, select the **Open Copilot** icon.

4.  The Copilot window that appears contains a prompt field and a menu of edit options below it. In the prompt field, ask Copilot to write a short, direct email to your colleagues on the Finance team requesting feedback on your draft contract comparison presentation. In your Copilot prompt, copy and paste in the link to the Loop workspace. Ask Copilot to include this link for collaboration purposes with your Finance colleagues. Use a professional, formal tone and convey urgency.

5.  Review the results. Upon review, you decide that maybe a different approach would be best. You decide to use Copilot to modify the email to make it more conversational and friendly in tone. In the Copilot window that appears below the message, ask Copilot to start the email by highlighting the benefits of using the Loop component for real-time collaboration. Then ask it to explain in greater detail why feedback is important, and have it outline the next steps.

6.  Review the updated email. Notice how Copilot generated a new version of the email, which is draft 2 (2 of 2). You can select the back arrow to go to draft 1 of 2, which was the original version of the email that Copilot generated. Since you prefer to keep working with the latest draft, select the forward arrow to return to draft 2 of 2. 

   > [!NOTE]
   > For each request that you make, Copilot generates a new draft of the email. You can optionally navigate to a prior draft and keep it, or you can ask Copilot to modify that draft (rather than the last draft). By default, you typically make each new request while viewing the last draft. 

7. While you like the content of draft 2, you feel that a different structure might be better. Ask Copilot to rewrite the email and list the key points for review in bullet format. Start the email by stressing the deadline for feedback.

8.  Review the results (which is now draft 3 of 3). While the email looks better, you decide that you need one final paragraph. Ask Copilot to add a single paragraph at the end of the email that explains how your colleagues’ input should improve the final deliverable. Include a motivating phrase like ‘Your insights will make a big impact.’

9.  Review the results. After re-reading the email, you aren’t sure about the tone of the message. In the Copilot menu, scroll down and select **Change Tone** and then select one of the tones from the menu.

10.  Review the new draft that Copilot generated. You still aren’t satisfied with the way the email sounds, so this time ask Copilot to change the tone by making it sound friendly and confident but still professional.

11. Review the results. You’re satisfied with this version, so select the **Keep it** option in the Copilot window. Doing so takes you out of Copilot draft mode and into the actual email itself. 

12.  Feel free to send the email to your personal email address. Verify that you received it and that the link to the Loop component works.
