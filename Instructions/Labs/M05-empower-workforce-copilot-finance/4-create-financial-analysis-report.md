# Create a financial analysis report using Microsoft 365 Copilot in Word
---
Microsoft 365 Copilot in Word can help Finance professionals create documents more efficiently. It can help them write content, research topics, and transform existing content into a document they can be proud of. Copilot can also save them time and thought by rewriting and editing documents.

For example, if you're a financial analyst and need to write a report on the performance of a company, you can use Copilot in Word to draft the report. You can tell Copilot to "Write a report on the financial performance of XYZ company" and it generates a draft that you can refine. You can ask Copilot Chat questions to research, ideate, or iterate on for possible content to add.

If you're working on an existing document, Copilot can help you rewrite and edit the document, saving you time and thought. In this exercise, you instruct Copilot in Word to write a new report based on the data from the Fabrikam Q1 Marketing Campaign spreadsheet that was copied to a Word document.

### Exercise

As Fabrikam's Director of Finance, you used Copilot in Excel to analyze the effectiveness of the company's Q1 marketing campaigns in the prior exercise. In this exercise, you plan to use Copilot in Word to generate a report that summarizes the analysis of that data. The spreadsheet was copied and pasted for you into a Word document, which you download in the first step.

1. Select the following link to download the [Fabrikam Q1 marketing campaign data](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2268926).
1. After the download is finished, move the file to your **Microsoft - OneDrive** folder, and then open and close the file to get it in your Most Recently Used (MRU) file list.
1. If you have a **Microsoft 365** tab open in your Microsoft Edge browser, then select it now; otherwise, open a new tab and enter the following URL: [**https://www.office.com**](https://www.office.com)
1. In **Microsoft 365**, open **Microsoft Word** and then open a blank document.
1. In the **Copilot** prompt field that appears at the top of the blank document, enter the following prompt, but don't select the **Generate** button until after you link the file to the prompt in the next step: **I'm the Director of Finance for Fabrikam. Please create a Q1 Marketing Campaign Analysis report based on the attached file, which provides data on our Q1 marketing campaigns. Include the following sections in the report: Executive Summary, Data Analysis, and Recommendations**.
1. You now must attach to the prompt the **Fabrikam Q1 marketing campaign data.docx** file that you downloaded. In the **Copilot** prompt field, select the **+Add content** button. In the drop-down menu that appears, select the **Files** tab, and then in the list of MRU files, select  the **Fabrikam Q1 marketing campaigns data.docx** file. Note how the file is displayed in the prompt.
1. Select the **Generate** icon in the prompt field. Upon doing so, Copilot extracts the pertinent information from the file and drafts a report that analyzes the data. Note the Copilot window that appears at the end of the report. It says you're working on draft 1 of 1. Since you're working in draft mode, you're not using the Copilot pane. The Copilot pane is used when you're working on an actual Word document. However, in this case, you're working with Copilot drafts in Word, so you must use the Copilot window that appears at the end of the draft. Review the results of this first draft. 
1. For this exercise, you want Copilot to reformat the **Executive Summary** section at the start of the draft. Our testing has shown that Copilot typically presents the Executive Summary in either bulleted list, table, or paragraph format. If the data  is presented in a bulleted list, then you want Copilot to change it to a table format. If it's in a table or paragraph format, then you want Copilot to change it to a bulleted list. Hereâ€™s the prompt that you should enter: **Please convert the information in the Executive Summary section into a {table or bulleted list} format.** 
    - If the Executive Summary is presented in a bulleted list, then enter the following prompt and replace **{table or bulleted list}** with **table**. 
    - If the **Executive Summary** data is in a table or paragraph format, then enter following prompt and replace **{table or bulleted list}** with **bulleted list**: **Please convert the information in the Executive Summary section into a {table or bulleted list} format**.
1. In our testing, Copilot updated the Executive Summary just fine, but it sometimes failed to show the rest of the document, or it displayed headings only. If this situation happens to you, then select the back arrow in the Copilot window to return to draft 1 and enter the following prompt: Please convert the information in the Executive Summary section into a {table or bulleted list} format. Display all the remaining sections in their entirety.**
1. In our testing, Copilot created anywhere multiple campaign metrics in the **Data Analysis** section. If these metrics are already in a table format, then proceed to the next step. Otherwise, enter the following prompt to place all the metrics into tables so that it's easier to read: **Please convert the information for each metric in the Data Analysis section into a table format.**
1. You like the **Recommendations**, but you feel they would be more valuable if Copilot displayed the data in order of importance. Enter the following prompt to have Copilot make this change: **In the Recommendations section, display the items in order of importance, starting with the most important item**.
1. After reviewing this latest draft, you're satisfied with the report and you're ready to save it. In the Copilot window at the bottom of the document, select the **Keep it** button to convert it from a Copilot draft to a Word document.
1. Review the document. Once you're satisfied with it, you can either discard the document or save it to your OneDrive for future reference.
1. Close this tab in your Microsoft Edge browser.
