# Exercise 1, Task 3: Use Copilot Chat to analyze a potential acquisition
---
Fabrikam’s executive team is evaluating the potential acquisition of Relecloud, Ltd. Robin Kline, Fabrikam’s Finance Manager, sent you a detailed business perspective for Relecloud. It provides an overview of the company’s market position and industry analysis, financial performance, customer and sales insights, operations and capabilities, intellectual property, product roadmap, risks and challenges, and future outlook. 

Robin tasked you with analyzing and summarizing the document into three concise areas:

- **Relecloud’s financial data**. Summarize the key financial figures and trends.

- **Operations analysis of Relecloud**. Highlight efficiency, scalability, and organizational structure.

- **Integration plan for the acquisition**. Identify main steps and dependencies for merging Relecloud into Fabrikam’s structure.

This exercise demonstrates how Copilot Chat can extract, categorize, and structure complex financial information into actionable summaries, helping analysts prepare polished insights faster. It also shows how detailed prompts can provide much more satisfactory results than less detailed, high-level prompts.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  Select the following link to download the **Relecloud Business Perspective.docx** file. Store the file in your OneDrive account for use by Copilot in your tenant.

2.  In your Microsoft Edge browser, go to the **Microsoft 365** home page. Since this task involves reviewing a file uploaded to OneDrive and generating insights from that internal document, select the **Work** option. The **Web** option doesn’t apply here, since it searches external sources like public websites and blogs.

3.  In the Copilot prompt field, attach the **Relecloud Business Perspective.docx** file that you downloaded in step 1. Based off of Robin Kline’s request, ask Copilot to review the attached document and create a business perspective summary that contains the following three sections: Relecloud’s financial data, Operations analysis of Relecloud, and Integration plan for the acquisition.

4.  Upon reviewing the results, you feel that Copilot’s summary was a good start, but it didn’t get into the level of detail that you feel is necessary for a comprehensive analysis of Relecloud’s business. In looking at your previous prompt, you simply asked for a summary containing three sections, but you didn’t provide any details as to what you really wanted Copilot to include in those sections. When you leave those types of decisions up to Copilot, its results might not always meet your expectations.  
    <br/>This time, ask Copilot to create an expanded version of this previous report. Tell it to include all the information that was in the previous summary, since you don’t want to lose any of that data. But this time, also add the following information:  
    - In the **Financial analysis** section, include:
        - Valuation and deal structure, including valuation multiples and deal structure implications
        - Financial health and ratios, including liquidity and solvency, profitability trends, gross-to-net retention by cohort, regional annual recurring revenue (ARR) dynamics, and cash flow analysis
        - Revenue and customer concentration, including revenue breakdown, customer concentration risk, customer concentration by sector/vertical, and churn and retention drivers
        - The following visual:
            - **Line or Bar Charts:** Revenue, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), and net income trends over time, plus gross margin and operating margin trends.  
                
    - In the **Operations analysis** section, include:
        - Cost structure and efficiency, including COGS and operating expenses (OpEx) analysis, efficiency metrics, and scalability assessment
        - Competitive positioning, including strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis and peer benchmarking
        - The following visuals:
            - **SWOT Matrix:** Visual grid summarizing strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
            - **Scalability Assessment Diagram:** Illustrates development, security, and operations (DevSecOps) practices, infrastructure, and organizational scalability.  
                
    - In the **Integration Planning** section, include:
        - Synergy and integration modeling, including synergy realization, integration risks, and a post-merger integration plan
        - Leadership and Organizational review, including management track record and organizational structure
        - The following visual:
            - **Integration Timeline (Gantt Chart):** Visualizes the phases and milestones of the post-merger integration plan.  
 
5.  Review the results. Note the difference between Copilot’s first summary report that was based on a high-level prompt, and this second summary report that was based on a much more detailed request. This exercise shows the importance of a detailed prompt that includes the four key elements of an effective prompt.


6.  Feel free to select any of Copilot’s suggested prompts if you want to update the summary even further. When you’re ready, ask Copilot to compile this information into a single downloadable document. Download the file once it’s generated and store it in your OneDrive account.
