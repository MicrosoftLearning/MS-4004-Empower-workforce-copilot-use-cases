# Exercise 2, Task 1: Use Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat to evaluate vendor contracts
---
Fabrikam's Finance Manager shared two vendor contracts with you, one from Adatum Corporation and another from Contoso, Ltd. Each contract contains clauses related to pricing, delivery schedules, warranty terms, and penalties for nonperformance. You need to understand how these contracts differ and which poses greater financial or operational risk to Fabrikam. You plan to use Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat to compare both contracts side by side and identify key differences, highlight risk areas, and summarize potential negotiation points, all of which you plan to store in a Word document for later use.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  Select the following links to download the two vendor contracts and then store the files in your OneDrive account for use by Copilot in your tenant:
    - **Adatum Corp smart sensor contract.docx**
    - **Contoso smart sensor contract.docx**

2.  In your Microsoft Edge browser, go to the **Microsoft 365** home page **(https://www.microsoft365.com)** and **select the Work option, which is used** for searching and analyzing internal organizational content (OneDrive, SharePoint, Teams, Outlook).

3.  Attach both contracts to the Copilot prompt and then ask Copilot to compare the two contracts.
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > For this first prompt, we’ve provided the text so you can see what an effective prompt looks like when it incorporates the four key elements discussed in the Introduction unit. You must write all remaining prompts in this exercise, but in doing so, you can use this prompt as a model to emulate._
    
    **I’m a Financial Analyst at Fabrikam, Inc., evaluating two vendor contracts as part of a Cost Optimization and Risk Reduction initiative. The contracts are for components supporting our new smart sensor product line. Can you please compare the contracts from Adatum Corporation and Contoso, Ltd. to identify key differences that could affect Fabrikam’s costs, supplier risk, and long-term financial performance. Use the two attached vendor contracts as reference materials. Focus on clauses related to pricing**, **delivery timelines**, **warranties, and liability or penalty terms. Provide a clear, bulleted summary that highlights major differences between the two contracts, identifies which contract poses higher financial and operational risk to Fabrikam, and suggests two or three negotiation points Fabrikam could raise to improve terms.**

4.  Review the comparison generated by Copilot. You want to save it to a Word document, so select the **Copy** icon that appears after the response.

5.  Open a new tab in your Microsoft Edge browser, go to the **Microsoft 365** home page, select **Apps** in the navigation pane, and then select **Word** from the Apps menu.
   
6.  In **Word for the web**, open a blank document in Word and paste in the response. Delete any extraneous text that was copied and pasted in from the chat session. Save the document as **Smart Sensor contract comparison**. Leave the document open as you plan to add additional information to it in the remaining steps.

7. Return to the browser tab containing your Copilot Chat session. Ask Copilot which contract has more favorable terms for Fabrikam, and why? Also ask where Fabrikam should focus its negotiation efforts.

8.  Copy the response and paste it at the end of the **Smart Sensor contract comparison** document. Delete any extraneous text that was copied and pasted in from the chat session (typically at the start and end of the copied text).

9.  Return to the Copilot Chat session. When financial analysts review supplier contracts in the real world, there are numerous areas they might consider including in their analysis. Typical areas include:

    - **Termination and exit clauses**. Companies typically focus on notice periods and conditions for early termination, penalties or costs associated with contract termination, and how outstanding obligations such as inventory and payments are handled upon termination.

    - **Volume flexibility and scalability**. Contracts commonly include provisions for increasing or decreasing order volumes without penalty, how price breaks or discounts scale with higher volumes, and whether there’s an option to adjust minimum order quantities as demand changes.

    - **Change management and amendments**. Analysts usually want to know how contract amendments or changes to specifications are handled, and whether there’s a formal process for managing changes in technology or regulatory requirements.

    - **Supplier performance and monitoring**. Companies usually push to define key performance indicators (KPIs) or service level agreements (SLAs) within supplier contracts, what the remedies are if the supplier consistently underperforms, and whether there’s a process for regular performance reviews or audits.

    - **Compliance and regulatory requirements**. Analysts usually want to know if a contract requires compliance with specific industry standards or regulation, and whether there are audit rights for them to verify compliance.

    - **Dispute resolution**. Companies usually want contracts to identify what mechanisms are in place for resolving disputes; for example, arbitration, mediation, or jurisdiction.

    - **Financial health and stability of the supplier**. Depending on the supplier, a company might want the contract to include clauses requiring the supplier to maintain certain financial ratios or insurance levels, and identify what happens if the supplier is acquired or undergoes significant financial distress.

10.  Instead of asking Copilot to compare the contracts across several areas at once, select just one area that’s of interest to you and ask Copilot to compare the contracts specifically on that point. Focusing on a single aspect can often yield more thorough and precise results than overloading Copilot with multiple requests in a single prompt.

11.  Copy the response and paste it at the end of the **Smart Sensor contract comparison** document. Delete any extraneous text that was copied and pasted in from the chat session.

12.  Repeat the prior step and ask Copilot to compare the contracts for one other area that’s of interest to you.

13.  Copy the response and paste it at the end of the **Smart Sensor contract comparison** document. Delete any extraneous text that was copied and pasted in from the chat session.

14.  If time permits, feel free to compare other areas if you wish. Make sure you save your final changes to the **Smart Sensor contract comparison** document. You plan to create a PowerPoint presentation based on this document in the next task.
