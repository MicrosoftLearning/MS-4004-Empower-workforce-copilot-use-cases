Your next task is to share the information that you captured in the **Smart Sensor contract comparison** document in tomorrow’s Finance leadership meeting. Visual clarity and brevity are key. You plan to use Copilot in PowerPoint (Office Agent) to generate a presentation that summarizes your key takeaways and includes recommendations for mitigating the identified risks. Ensure the deck is concise and visually engaging.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  In your Microsoft Edge browser, go to the **Microsoft 365** home page, select **Apps** in the navigation pane, and then select **PowerPoint** from the **Apps** menu.

2.  In **PowerPoint for the web**, create a blank presentation.

3.  In the Copilot menu that appears on the title slide for the blank presentation, select the **Create a new presentation with file** option.

4.  In the **Create a presentation with Copilot** window, enter in the prompt field a description of what you want Copilot to create. Remember to address the four key areas of an effective prompt. The presentation should include slides that summarize the key findings from the **Smart Sensor contract comparison** file, which you must attach. The presentation should be targeted to the Finance leadership team. It should include a separate slide for each key finding topic area, such as Pricing, Delivery Timelines and Terms, Warranties and Support, and so on. Each slide should compare the contract features for Adatum Corporation and Contoso, Ltd. for the selected area. Tell Copilot to use visuals and bullet points for clarity.

5.  Review the outline that Copilot generated. If you’re not satisfied with the outline, revise your prompt at the top of the form and resubmit it. Once you’re satisfied with the outline, select both the **Presentation style** and the **Image preferences** that you want to use, and then select the **Generate slides** button.

6.  It can sometimes take 3-5 minutes for Copilot to generate the slides. Once the slides are created, PowerPoint displays them in **Slide Sorter** mode. You want to see the slides in normal mode, so select **View** on the PowerPoint menu bar, and then select **Normal**.

7.  At this point, you have a solid foundation for your Finance leadership presentation. However, you want to take advantage of Copilot and have it enhance the presentation. There are two ways to use Copilot in PowerPoint:

    - If you select the **Copilot** button on the far-right end of the **Home** ribbon, the **Copilot Chat** pane opens. The Copilot Chat pane starts a chat with Copilot, but it generally can’t push changes directly into the slide deck. Instead, you must copy/paste from its responses.

    - The **Copilot** icon that appears above the first slide can directly change the open deck. For example, you can use this Copilot to add a slide or topic (a section with multiple slides) to the presentation.  

    Since you want to add a slide for risk mitigation, select where you want to add the slide in the list of slides (a red line should appear where you selected between two slides). Then select the **Copilot** icon that appears above the current slide. In the menu that appears, select **Add a slide**.

8.  In the **Add a slide with Copilot** window that appears, ask Copilot to add a slide that contains the top recommendations for mitigating risks. Since Copilot requires a topic for a new slide, tell it that the topic for the slide is “risk mitigation.” Ask it to include a visual emphasis, such as callouts or highlights, for critical points.

9.  Once Copilot generates the slide, you feel that it looks OK, so select the **Keep it** button. Did Copilot place the slide at the location you selected? If it didn’t, then drag and drop the slide to the proper location.

10.  You now want Copilot to generate speaker notes for each slide. For starters, check several of the slides to see if any speaker notes were currently applied at the time Copilot created the slides. During testing, every slide had the same note, which was simply a link to the **Smart Sensor contract comparison** file from which it pulled the data for the slide. 
    <br/><br/>While this type of note is fine, you want to include actual speaker notes that you can reference when you present each slide. To do so, you must first open the Copilot pane, and then ask Copilot to create concise speaker notes for each slide. For each slide, the speaker notes should explain the data on the slide and indicate which vendor offers better points than the other.

11.  Review the speaker notes that Copilot generated. As of this writing, Copilot can't directly edit or insert speaker notes into a PowerPoint file. Its capabilities are limited to generating and formatting content for you to copy and paste into your slides. As such, you have two options:

    - **Option 1**. For each slide, you can manually copy the speaker note Copilot generated for it and paste the note into the Notes section for the slide.

    - **Option 2**. You can have Copilot generate a downloadable file (Word or text) that contains all the notes labeled by slide. If you choose this option, you can then reference the notes from the file during your presentation.

    Because you don’t have time to copy and paste in the speaker notes for each slide, and since you like the idea of having printed notes in front of you during the presentation, ask Copilot to generate a downloadable Word document containing the notes for each slide.

13.  Download the speaker note file once Copilot generates the link for it. Open the file and verify that it includes all the speaker notes.

14.  Now ask Copilot to create an action plan slide that outlines the next steps for negotiations and risk mitigation. The topic for the slide should be “Next steps.” The slide should include timelines and responsible roles. Repeat the same instruction as before to add a new slide to the deck.

15.  Review the action plan slide that Copilot generated and then keep it.

16.  After looking more closely at this new slide, you feel that for presentation purposes, the content might be better served in a table format. As such, in the Copilot pane, ask Copilot to format the action plan information in slide XX (where XX is the next steps slide number) in a table format.

17. Once Copilot generates the table, add a new slide (select the **Title only** format) at the very end of your presentation and then copy the table and paste it into the slide. Enter **Action Plan: Next Steps for Negotiations & Risk Mitigation** as the title of the slide.

18. Save the PowerPoint file to your OneDrive account as **Smart Sensor contract comparison - Finance**.

19. You have one final request for Copilot. The current presentation was designed for the Finance department’s leadership team. However, after further consideration, you decide that you also want Copilot to generate a second version of this presentation for Fabrikam’s Executive Leadership Team (CEO, Corporate VPs, and so on). This version should:

    - Contain fewer slides focused on strategic insights rather than operational details.
    
    - Use more visuals and graphics for quick comprehension.
    
    - Include less granular detail, highlighting only key risks, recommendations, and business impact.
    
    Ask Copilot to generate this alternate presentation for Fabrikam’s Executive Leadership Team.
    
20.  Review the new slide deck. Compare how Copilot changed the messaging for executives versus the Finance team. Save the PowerPoint file to your OneDrive account as **Smart Sensor contract comparison – Executives.**
