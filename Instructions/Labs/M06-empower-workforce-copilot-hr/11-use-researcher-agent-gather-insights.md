As part of your relocation to the Adatum office in Fargo, North Dakota, you want to explore what it’s like to live in Fargo and nearby communities in both North Dakota and Minnesota. You plan to use this information to help decide where your family settles. Key considerations include quality of life, housing options, commute times, recreational opportunities, community amenities, and access to strong educational programs for your children.

You then ask Researcher to analyze the cities in which these communities are located and provide a ranking of the top areas to consider based on a combination of these factors.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  In your Microsoft Edge browser, you should still be in the **HR Self-Service Assistant** agent. In the list of agents in the navigation pane, select the **Researcher** agent.

2.  Specify that the agent should use only **Web** sources for this query.

3.  Enter a prompt that asks the agent to create a report analyzing Fargo and all surrounding communities within a 40-mile radius in both North Dakota and Minnesota. Use the most recent data available. Rank the cities based on overall quality of life and family-friendliness, and explain key trade-offs involved. Summarize its findings in a table for easy comparison. Include factors such as:

    - Housing market and affordability
    - Cost of living
    - Family-oriented amenities
    - Healthcare and safety
    - Lifestyle and community features
    - Taxes and financial considerations
    - Commute time to Fargo

4.  Review Researcher’s analysis of your request. If everything looks OK, tell it to **Go ahead**.

5.  Review the results. Now ask Researcher to create a report about public and private high schools in Fargo and the surrounding communities within a 40-mile radius. Use the most recent data available. Rank every school, treating all criteria equally in ranking. Summarize its findings in a table for easy comparison. Include factors such as:

    - Competitive athletic programs
    - Access to IB (International Baccalaureate) and AP (Advanced Placement) courses
    - College placement outcomes
    - Breadth of extracurricular activities
    - Student-teacher ratios
    - Graduation rates

6.  Review Researcher’s analysis of your request. If everything looks OK, tell it to **Go ahead**.

7.  Review the results. You now want to compare how the best communities and schools align, and identify trade-offs between location and education quality. Ask Researcher to create a table that compares the top five ranked cities from your community analysis with the top five ranked schools from your school analysis. Include columns for:

    - City name
    - School name
    - City ranking
    - School ranking
    - Key highlights (affordability, amenities, academic strengths)

8.  Review the results. As this task showed, Researcher can take even a short prompt and deliver a thorough, structured analysis using up‑to‑date web data. You can use this same capability to explore, compare, and evaluate almost any topic where research, comparison, or decision support is needed.
