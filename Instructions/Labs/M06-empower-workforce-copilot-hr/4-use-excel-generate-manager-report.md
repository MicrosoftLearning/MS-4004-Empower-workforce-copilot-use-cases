# Exercise 1, Task 2: Use Copilot in Excel to generate a Manager Summary report
---
You analyzed the **Contoso_HR_ManagerMetrics.xlsx** spreadsheet in Task 1 and identified trends in engagement, attrition, and training. You now want to perform a deeper analysis to generate actionable insights for each manager. This information should be captured in a Manager Summary report. Use Microsoft 365 Copilot in Excel to interpret the manager metrics from the provided dataset, summarize key findings, and identify opportunities for development in the Manager Summary report.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  The **Contoso_HR_ManagerMetrics.xlsx** file that you updated in Task 1 should still be open in **Excel for the web**. If the file is still open, then select the **Create new conversation** icon at the top of the **App Skills** pane to start a new chat. If you closed the file at the end of the previous task, then open it again along with the **Apps Skills** pane.

2.  Select **Sheet1** if necessary. In the **Apps Skills** pane, prompt Copilot to analyze the manager performance data and provide recommendations for improvement. Identify which managers are performing well versus those managers with opportunities for development. Also ask Copilot to summarize each manager’s top three strengths and areas for improvement. Display the results in a table that can be inserted into a new sheet.

3.  Review the results. Add the table to a new sheet titled **Manager Performance**.

4.  Ensure you’re still in the **Manager Performance** sheet. Ask Copilot to highlight which metrics most strongly correlate with high team performance. Display the results in a table that can be inserted into a new sheet.

5.  Review the results. Add the table to a new sheet titled **Team Performance**.

6.  Return to the **Manager Performance** sheet. Ask Copilot to highlight patterns between training and attrition rates by identifying any managers whose low training completion might be contributing to higher attrition.

7.  Review the results. Add the table to a new sheet titled **Training and Attrition**.

8.  Return to the **Manager Performance** sheet. You now want to export this sheet as a PDF file that you can email to leadership in Task 3 and use in your planning session in Task 4. To export this data sheet, select **File > Export > Download as PDF** (or it might say **Create PDF/XPS Document)**.

    - If you selected **Download as PDF** in your version of Excel, Copilot displays the PDF in the existing tab in your Microsoft Edge browser. In the **Export** pane that appears, select the **Download** button. Copilot downloads a PDF file containing the table from the Manager Performance sheet. The file is stored in your PC’s **Downloads** folder. Copy this file from the **Downloads** folder to your OneDrive.


    - If you selected **Create PDF/XPS Document** in your version of Excel, Copilot opens a **File Explorer** window. Save the file to your OneDrive.
