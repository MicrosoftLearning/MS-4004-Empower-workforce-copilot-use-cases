# Exercise 1, Task 3: Use Copilot in Outlook to communicate findings to HR leadership
---
The Manager Performance report that you created in the prior task analyzes data from the **Contoso_HR_ManagerMetrics.xlsx** file and identifies each manager’s top 3 strengths and recommended areas for improvement. Your goal is to communicate these findings to the HR senior leadership team in a clear and professional manner, helping them understand strengths, opportunities, and actionable steps for development.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  In your Microsoft Edge browser, go to the **Microsoft 365** home page, select **Apps** in the navigation pane, and then select **Outlook** from the **Apps** menu.

2.  In **Outlook on the web**, create a new email and attach the Manager Performance file that you stored on your OneDrive at the end of the prior task.

3.  In the body of the message, select the **Open Copilot** (pencil) icon that appears next to the attached file.

4.  The Copilot window that appears contains a prompt field and a menu of edit options below it. In the prompt field, ask Copilot to draft an email to Contoso’s HR Director that’s based on the attached Manager Summary report. The email should summarize the company’s recent manager performance metrics, strengths, and areas for improvement. It should also include actionable recommendations and specific data points from the table that are found in the attached file.

5.  Review the results.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If you attach a file to your email before submitting your Copilot prompt, as in this task, Outlook assumes you want Copilot to help draft or modify the message. In this case, Copilot opens a draft window and places its response there. From that point on, you can continue working with Copilot directly in the draft—asking it to revise, expand, or refine the content—until you’re ready to insert or send it. If you don’t attach a file, Copilot doesn’t use draft mode. Instead, it generates its response directly within the body of your current email. After that, you must highlight the specific text you want Copilot to modify, whether that’s a sentence, a paragraph, or the entire email. Later in this task, once you insert the drafted email, you use this method to modify the email contents.

6.  Note how the drafted email appears in a separate window and not in the actual body of the email. This draft is the first version of the email. You can continue modifying this draft until you’re satisfied with it and you want to insert it into the actual email itself. You want to keep modifying this draft, so in the Copilot window that appears below the draft, ask Copilot to make the message concise and actionable.

7.  Review the results of your request. Note how this draft is now draft 2 of 2.

8.  In the Copilot window, one of the edit options is **Change Tone**. Select one of the tones that you want from the menu that’s displayed.

9.  Review the results. Continue to make any updates that you feel are necessary. Try different tones and lengths. Note how the draft number changes with each change request.

10.  You can select the backward and forward arrows to go back through the prior drafts to view the changes. Review each of the drafts. Once you settle on a specific draft that you would like to use, ensure that draft is displayed in the draft window. To insert the draft into the actual email, select the **Replace** option in the Copilot menu.

11.  Review the results, where Copilot inserted the draft into the actual body of the email. Now, once you use Copilot to draft the initial email, you can still use it to modify the email even after inserting the draft.

        - When modifying an actual email message, you must highlight the portion of the email that you want changed, whether it be a sentence, paragraph, or the entire email.
    
        - Or if you want Copilot to add more text to the email, you must position the cursor where you want Copilot to insert the text.

        In looking at the email, you decide to make one more change. You want to add one final paragraph at the end that mentions how you’re looking forward to moving ahead with these actionable insights to help improve the management culture at Contoso. You want this paragraph at the very end, so select the last sentence or paragraph in the email. That way, you can have Copilot insert this new paragraph after the selected sentence or paragraph. When you select into the email, note how Copilot displays the **Open Copilot** (pencil) icon.

12.  Select the **Open Copilot** icon. In the Copilot window that appears, ask Copilot to add a paragraph that mentions how you’re looking forward to moving ahead with these actionable insights to help improve the management culture at Contoso.

13.  Review the results. Note how Copilot opened a new draft window with just this paragraph. Once you’re satisfied with the paragraph, select the **Insert below** option to insert the new paragraph below where the cursor is located.

        > [!NOTE]
        > Let’s assume you highlighted a sentence, paragraph, or the entire email that you wanted Copilot to rewrite. In that case, you would select the **Replace** option rather than the **Insert below** option.

14.  Review the results. After re-reading the paragraph that you just added, you aren’t sure about its tone, so you want to try different tones until you find one that agrees with you. Drag your cursor over the paragraph that you just added to highlight it, and then select the **Open Copilot** icon that appears.

15.  In the Copilot menu, scroll down and select **Change Tone** and then select the tone that you want from the menu that’s displayed.

16.  Review the results of the modified paragraph that appears in the draft window. You still aren’t satisfied with the way the paragraph sounds, so try a different tone.

17.  Review the results. You don’t care for this version either. You’re not happy with either of the predefined Tone options, so this time you decide to ask Copilot to change the tone by making it sound friendly and confident but still professional.

18.  Review the results. You want to compare each version, so select the backward and forward arrows to go back through the prior drafts of this paragraph. Review each one, and when you finally decide on one to use, make sure that’s the one displayed in the draft window. Then select the **Replace** option to replace the current version of the paragraph with this selected draft version.

19.  Note how Copilot replaces the original version of the paragraph with this modified version. You’re now done with the email. If you want, go ahead and send it to your personal email address and then verify you received the email and it contains the attached document.
