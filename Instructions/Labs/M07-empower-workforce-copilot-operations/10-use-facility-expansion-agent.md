In this task, you take on the role of Contoso project manager who’s involved in the expansion project at the Fargo distribution center. Each day, you find yourself wondering about different aspects of project. Rather than inundating the Operations team with your questions, you decide to take advantage of the Facility Expansion FAQ Assistant to answer your questions.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  The **Facility Expansion FAQ Assistant** should still be open from the prior task. If not, then select the agent on the Microsoft 365 home page.

2.  Start a conversation with your **Facility Expansion FAQ Assistant**. Ask questions about the following topics related to the distribution center expansion:

    - What’s the temporary evacuation route from Packing?

    - Are forklifts allowed in the new wing this week?

    - When do SKU CHAI‑12 and COFF‑08 move to the new racks?

3.  Observe how the agent’s responses cite or summarize information from the policy files. Observe how the agent’s responses cite or summarize information from the policy files. Evaluate the completeness and clarity of the agent’s answers. Note any policies that might need to be updated for better self-service accuracy.

4.  Now ask some questions that aren’t covered by the knowledge source documents, such as:

    - What is the total cost of the Fargo expansion project, and which contractor submitted the lowest bid?
        - **Expected outcome:** None of the knowledge sources contain any financials, bids, cost breakdowns, or vendor contract terms. The agent should decline politely and provide fallback, such as “contact the Project Controller.”

    - Will the new wing include an automated picking system or robotics platform?
        - **Expected outcome:** The overview mentions systems in general (electrical, HVAC, lighting), but not specific technology purchases. The agent should indicate that the information isn’t available.

5.  Evaluate how the agent responded to questions that aren’t covered in the knowledge source files. Did the agent provide an appropriate fallback response?

6.  Now ask some questions that are partially covered by the knowledge source documents, such as:

    - When will the facility return to normal routing, and what permanent safety procedures will replace the temporary ones?
        - **Expected outcome:** The agent can provide partial information, since the knowledge sources provide timelines, temporary routing, and temporary PPE. However, the knowledge sources don’t provide information on permanent future procedures or post-project traffic designs. The agent should answer what is known and flag what’s missing.

    - Exactly how many pallets do we plan to move during Wave 5, and what’s the breakdown by product category?
        - **Expected outcome:** The agent can provide partial information, since the knowledge sources provide estimated quantities and SKU groups. However, the knowledge sources don’t provide information on full SKU lists, product categories, and pallet-level detail. The agent should answer what is known and flag what’s missing.  
            
7.  Evaluate how the agent responded to questions that are partially covered in the knowledge source files. Did the agent provide an appropriate fallback response for the portions of the questions that weren’t covered in the knowledge source documents?
