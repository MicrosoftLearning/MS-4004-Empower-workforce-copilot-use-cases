# Exercise 2, Task 5: Use Copilot in Outlook to email the safety procedure changes to Operations staff
---
With the updated safety procedures summarized in OneNote and saved to a PDF file, it’s time to distribute the information to the Operations staff across the Fargo distribution center. Leadership wants staff to understand the changes before the next shift rotation, ensuring everyone is aware of new risks, restricted areas, and emergency updates. You plan to use Copilot in Outlook to draft a clear, informative communication and share the summary with the Operations team.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  In your Microsoft Edge browser, go to the **Microsoft 365** home page, select **Apps** in the navigation pane, and then select **Outlook** from the **Apps** menu.

2.  In **Outlook on the web**, create a new email. Attach the PDF file of the Summary report that you saved to your OneDrive at the end of the prior task.

3.  In the body of the message, select the **Open Copilot** (pencil) icon that appears next to the attached file.

4.  The Copilot window that appears contains a prompt field and a menu of edit options below it. In the prompt field, ask Copilot to create an email to Contoso’s Operations staff at its Fargo distribution center. Ask Copilot to:

    - Summarize the updates to the distribution center’s safety protocols that are found in the attached PDF file.

    - Include specific data points from the report into the email. At a minimum, identify new risks and restricted areas.

    - Highlight key insights, but keep the message concise and actionable.

5.  Review the results.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If you attach a file to your email before submitting your Copilot prompt, as in this task, Outlook assumes you want Copilot to help draft or modify the message. In this case, Copilot opens a draft window and places its response there. From that point on, you can continue working with Copilot directly in the draft—asking it to revise, expand, or refine the content—until you’re ready to insert or send it.
    
    If you don’t attach a file, Copilot doesn’t use draft mode. Instead, it generates its response directly within the body of your current email. After that, you’ll need to highlight the specific text you want Copilot to modify, whether that’s a sentence, a paragraph, or the entire email. Later in this task, once you insert the drafted email, you use this method to modify the email contents.

6.  Note how the drafted email appears in a separate window and not in the actual body of the email. This version is the first draft of the email. You can continue modifying this draft until you’re satisfied with it and you want to insert it into the actual email itself. 
<br/><br/>You want to keep modifying this draft, so in the Copilot window that appears below the draft, ask Copilot to include information on emergency updates.

7.  Review the results. You’re satisfied with this final update, so you’re ready to insert the draft into the actual email. In the Copilot menu, select the **Replace** option to replace the existing email (which is blank) with this final draft.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you preferred one of the earlier drafts, you could select the forward or backward arrows to view each draft. Ensure the draft you want to use is displayed when you select the **Replace** option since that’s the draft that Copilot replaces the email with.

8.  Review the results. Copilot should insert the draft into the actual body of the email. Now, once you use Copilot to draft the initial email, you can still use it to modify the email even after inserting the draft.

    - When modifying an actual email message, you must highlight the portion of the email that you want changed, whether it be a sentence, paragraph, or the entire email.

    - Or if you want Copilot to add more text to the email, you must position the cursor where you want Copilot to insert the text.

    In looking at the email, you decide to make one more change. You’re not sure about the tone of the email, so drag your cursor over the entire email to highlight all of its content. When you do so, note how Copilot displays the **Open Copilot** (pencil) icon.

9.  In the Copilot menu, select **Change Tone**, and then select one of the tone options.

10.  Review the results of the modified email that appears in the draft window. You still aren’t satisfied with the way it sounds, so try a different tone.

11.  Note how Copilot creates a second draft using the new tone. You’re satisfied with this version of the email, so select the **Replace** option to replace the current version of the email with this draft version.

12.  After proofing the email one last time, you aren't sure whether the paragraph on emergency updates should be longer. You decide to have Copilot draft a longer version of this paragraph to see how it sounds. To do so, highlight just that paragraph and then select the **Open Copilot** icon.

13.  In the Copilot menu that appears, select the **Make it longer** option. Copilot opens a draft window and creates an expanded version of that paragraph. After reading this updated version, you feel that the original version sounds better for your audience. You don’t want to implement this expanded version, so select the **Discard** option in the Copilot menu.

14.  Notice how Copilot returns you to the email with the original version of the emergency updates paragraph left intact.

15.  At this point, you’re happy with the email. For lab purposes, send the email to your personal email address. Verify that you received the email and were able to open the report.


At the end of this task, you should receive a professional, data-driven email that provides Contoso’s Operations staff with visibility into the safety protocol changes being implemented as part of the expansion project to the Fargo distribution center.
