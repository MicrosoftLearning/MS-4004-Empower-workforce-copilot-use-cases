### Scenario

Adatum Corporation’s 50‑year‑old office building has a failing boiler. As the company’s Operations Manager, you must evaluate whether to repair or replace the boiler system—and if replacing, whether to convert from a boiler to a furnace. Your goal is to use Microsoft 365 Copilot to help you move from brainstorming to research to executive communication to decision and vendor engagement, all in a single day’s workflow.

This workflow is reflected in the following tasks that you plan to complete this day:

- **Morning: Ideate and organize using Copilot in Whiteboard**. You want to use Copilot in Whiteboard to brainstorm the installation project. Copilot generates “sticky‑note” ideas and helps you categorize them into themes (for example, project plan steps, risk mitigation, and downtime minimization), just like a facilitated sticky‑note session—only virtual.

- **Mid‑morning: Research and document using Copilot in Word**. You shift to Word to have Copilot generate a comparative report (boiler vs. furnace).

- **Early afternoon: Communicate and persuade using Copilot in PowerPoint**. With the comparative report saved to OneDrive, you use Copilot in PowerPoint to turn the report into an executive presentation, refine topics before generating slides, add speaker notes, insert supporting images, and create a Q\\&A slide for stakeholder dialogue.

- **Late afternoon: Decide and engage using Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat**. You close the loop by using Copilot Chat to synthesize everything produced so far, frame a request for proposal (RFP), and prepare for vendor engagement and leadership decision.
