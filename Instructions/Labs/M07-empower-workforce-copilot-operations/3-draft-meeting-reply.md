# Draft a meeting reply using Microsoft 365 Copilot in Outlook
---
Operations managers conduct much of their daily work in Outlook. For example, Operations managers use Outlook to help:

- **Coordinate projects**. They receive updates from team members, stakeholders, and vendors through email. By replying within the same email thread, the manager can track the progress, address any issues, and provide guidance without cluttering their inbox.
- **Approve requests**. For example, budget proposals, purchase orders, and leave requests. Replying within the existing email thread ensures context, allows for quick decision-making, and maintains an audit trail.
- **Troubleshoot operational issues**. Because Operations Managers collaborate with cross-functional teams, email threads help document the problem-solving process, including discussions, decisions, and action items.
- **Negotiate contracts, pricing, or terms with vendors**. Because threaded emails maintain a record of negotiations, the Operations Manager can refer to previous messages and agreements.

In this training, you use Microsoft 365 Copilot in Outlook to summarize an actual email thread in your Inbox and then draft a potential reply to the latest email in this thread.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Copilot scenarios in Outlook are only available on a user's primary mailbox. They aren't available on a user's archive mailbox, group mailboxes, or shared and delegate mailboxes that the user has access to. Microsoft only supports Copilot in Outlook on mailboxes hosted on Exchange Online. Additionally, Copilot in Outlook is only supported in Microsoft 365 work or school accounts and Microsoft accounts with specific email domains. It's supported both through Microsoft 365 Copilot with your Microsoft Entra ID account, and Copilot Pro with your MSA account. Any Microsoft account that uses a third-party email provider can still access Outlook, but it can't access Copilot features in Outlook.

Also remember from previous use cases that Copilot in Outlook can create multiple drafts of the same email. They can have a different tone and length, along with different content. You can then navigate through the various drafts by selecting the forward and backward arrows at the top of the Copilot window.

As you review a generated draft, keep in mind the best practices you learned from previous training. Analyze the salutation, the complementary close, and the overall message tone and length. Also review the context of the message to ensure that its explanations aren't too simplistic or too complicated given the target audience.

### Exercise

In this exercise, you want to use Copilot in Outlook to summarize an actual email thread in your Outlook Inbox. When you summarize an email, Copilot extracts key points from multiple messages and automatically provides a summary based on the message bodies of the thread. When you're working with a lengthy thread, this feature can save you a large amount of time determining who made what decisions and took what actions.

When you summarize a long thread, Copilot may ignore older messages in the conversation. There are limitations on how much data Copilot can pass into the large language models (LLMs). 

> [!NOTE]
> If this situation occurs, Copilot displays a warning indicating the summary doesn't represent the full thread.

You want to use Copilot in Outlook to draft a reply to a selected thread. You can see how Copilot uses the context of that thread in generating a potential reply.

1. In your Microsoft Edge browser, open a new tab and enter the following URL to go to the Microsoft 365 home page: [**https://www.office.com**](https://www.office.com)
1. On the **Microsoft 365** home page, if an **Outlook** icon appears in the left-hand navigation pane, then select it now and proceed to the next step. Otherwise, select the **Apps** icon, and on the **Apps** page, select **Outlook**.
1. In **Outlook**, open an existing email in your **Inbox**. If possible, select an email that's a reply from another person to ensure the thread includes at least two emails (the original plus at least one reply). The more emails in the thread the better for this exercise.
1. At the top of the email, Outlook displays a Copilot option that says: **Summary by Copilot**. Select this option.
1. Review the summary created by Copilot. As you can see, Copilot summarized the decisions that were made in the thread, along with the suggested actions.
1. At the bottom of the **Summary by Copilot** window, select the **Ask Copilot** button. Doing so opens a **Copilot** pane.
1. In the Copilot pane, note the various actions that you can have Copilot perform based on this thread. Select the **Understand** option, which directs Copilot to describe the key points in this email. 
1. Below the list of key points are some suggested prompts you can select based on the key points. Select one of the suggested prompts and note Copilot's response.
1. Now scroll back to the top of the **Copilot** pane to select any of the other actions. For example, select **Ask**, which directs Copilot to generate a list of follow-up questions based on this email. 
1. Below the list of questions, select one of the suggested prompts and note Copilot's response.
1. In the **Copilot** pane, select the **X** in the upper-right corner of the pane to close it.
1. In the **Summary by Copilot** window, select the **X** in the upper-right corner of the window to discard the summarization. The selected email should remain open.
1. Select the **Reply all** option in the Outlook ribbon.
1. Select the **Copilot** button towards the far-right side of the Outlook ribbon. In the drop-down menu that appears, select **Draft**.
1. In the body of the message, a **Copilot** window appears. Below the **What do you want this email to say**? message is a list of suggested prompts that you can use when creating your reply to this email thread.
1. Enter the following prompt in the **What do you want this email to say**? prompt field and then select the **Generate** button: **Please draft a reply to this email thread. Thanks**!
1. Scroll through the response. In the Copilot window, you can change the tone and length of the reply. Each option generates a new draft.  Take a moment and change the tone. Review the response. Note the Salutation, the complementary close, the overall change in tone, and the new details that Copilot included.
1. Next, change the length of the reply to make it either longer or shorter, depending on your preference. Note the change to the new draft that's created. 
1. While you're satisfied with the reply, you noticed a Tone option that you feel you must try out of pure curiosity. This time, change the **Tone** to **Like a poem**.
1. Enjoy the response, and then select the trash can (**Discard**) icon in the upper right corner of the email screen to delete the draft of this reply.
