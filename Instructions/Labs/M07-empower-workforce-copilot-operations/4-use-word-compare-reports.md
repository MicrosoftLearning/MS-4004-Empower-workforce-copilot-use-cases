# Exercise 1, Task 2: Use Copilot in Word to compare operational reports
---
As the Operations Manager at Adatum Corporation, you discovered the current boiler system that heats the company's 50-year-old office building needs significant repair, if not outright replacement. You feel that this situation might be the opportune time to convert your heating system from the existing boiler system to a more energy-efficient furnace system. However, you aren’t familiar with the differences between the two types of heating systems. As such, you want to investigate the situation and create a report that you can present to management.

Since you want to create a report using public web data (in this case, related to heating systems), you naturally think of using Microsoft 365 Word. You heard that Copilot in Word can generate reports for you, so you want to take this opportunity to not only create your report but also investigate Copilot's reporting features. Microsoft 365 Copilot in Word provides two different means of accessing public web data:

- You can ask Copilot to write a report about a certain topic - for example, what's the difference between a boiler versus furnace heating system. When you ask Copilot to write a report based on this type of question, it typically creates thorough, detailed content.

- You can ask the same question within the Copilot pane. In this scenario, Copilot typically provides a shorter, more summarized answer to that same question. This feature is designed to supplement existing documents should you need to access public web data when doing so.

In this task, you're going to examine these two options. The purpose of this task is to show how Copilot in Word provides a different level of response depending on which modality you use - either in the Copilot pane or when creating a new document. This difference doesn’t mean that one method is better than the other. Rather, each Copilot modality has its own place. The one you decide to use should depend on your reporting requirement. For example, when you use Copilot to create a new report, you probably need more detailed information. However, if you use Copilot to generate content that you can insert into an existing document, then you probably want smaller, more summarized chunks of information.  

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  In your Microsoft Edge browser, go to the **Microsoft 365** home page, select **Apps** in the navigation pane, and then select **Word** from the **Apps** menu.

2.  In **Word for the web**, open a blank document.

3.  In the **Copilot** window that appears at the top of the blank document, tell Copilot that you’re the Operations Manager for Adatum Corporation, and that you’re thinking about possibly replacing your building's current boiler system with a furnace system. Ask it to generate a report that describes what type of boiler systems are used in most commercial buildings. The report should also include:

    - Considerations when changing from an existing boiler system to a furnace system
    
    - The average cost of transitioning from a boiler system to a furnace system in a commercial two-story building built in the 1970s
    
    - Whether changing from a boiler system to a furnace system can affect on our current air conditioning system
    
    - The average defect rates for boiler systems versus furnace systems

4.  Review the report that Copilot generated. Note the level of detail in each area of interest. Since you must save this document for the next task, select the **Keep it** button on the Copilot tray and then save the document with the title **Heating System Comparison.docx** to your **Microsoft – OneDrive** folder.

5.  The remaining steps in this task are designed to show you the different ways in which Copilot functions in Microsoft Word.  
    <br/>The prompt you entered in Step 2 to create the report included multiple requests for different pieces of information. You now want to ask Copilot each of those questions individually, which you do using the Copilot pane. On the **Home** tab in Word, select **Copilot** on the ribbon, which opens the **Copilot** pane.

6.  In the **Copilot** pane, in the prompt field at the bottom of the pane, ask Copilot: **What type of boilers do most commercial buildings use as part of their heating systems?**

7.  Review the answer. While you can select the **Insert** button that appears below the response if you want to paste it into the document, you’re NOT going to update the document. Instead, you're just going to select more prompts to see the responses that that Copilot provides in the Copilot pane. Enter a separate prompt for each of the following questions and review each individual response:

    - **What considerations do I need to take into account to change from an existing boiler system to a furnace system in a commercial building?**
    
    - **What is an average cost for transitioning from a boiler system to a furnace system in a commercial two-story building built in the 1970s?**
    
    - **If we change from a boiler system to a furnace system, will it have any effect on our current air conditioning system?**
    
    - **What are the average defect rates for boiler systems versus furnace systems?**

8.  Note how Copilot answered each of your questions. In each case, it didn't insert any of the answers into the current document. While you can insert each answer into the document (either through an **Insert** button or by copying the content and pasting it into the document), it seems apparent that having Copilot create the report is more efficient than asking multiple questions in the Copilot pane.

9.  While efficiency is one thing, the level or quality of information provided by each method is another. How does the level of information for each reporting method compare to one another? Compare the level of information provided when Copilot in Word created a report versus the answers it provided when you asked the questions individually in the Copilot pane. What did you notice?  
    <br/>When you ask Copilot to create a report, it usually provides richer responses that it organizes into an attractive looking report. Conversely, when you ask Copilot to answer questions individually in the Copilot pane, it doesn't return the level of detail as the report. Although the Copilot pane does allow you to insert the responses into a document, it doesn’t automatically create headings or sections.  
    <br/>The key thing to remember about using the Copilot pane is that it’s designed to supplement content in an existing document. While Copilot doesn't automatically insert the answers into the document, you can insert it if you wish. However, as you saw in this task, the answers are usually summarized and not as detailed as the information provided by Copilot when it created the report. If you’re using the Copilot pane but you find yourself needing more detailed information than what it provides, you can always use Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat to answer your questions. Copilot Chat usually provides more detailed information than the Copilot pane.
