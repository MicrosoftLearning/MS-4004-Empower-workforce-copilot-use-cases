# Create a presentation comparing heating systems using Microsoft 365 Copilot in PowerPoint
---
Proficiency in using Microsoft 365 Copilot in PowerPoint is a strategic skill for professionals aiming to elevate the impact of their presentations. In the corporate world, effective communication through compelling slide decks is paramount - even in the world of Operations management. Copilot in PowerPoint serves as an intelligent collaborator, offering real-time suggestions and enhancements as Operation managers craft their presentations. This tool not only accelerates the creation process but also ensures that the content is engaging, clear, and resonant with the intended audience.

Operations managers may need to create PowerPoint presentations for various reasons. For example, they may need to:

- **Report on operational efficiency improvements**. Copilot can generate a succinct overview of key metrics, cost savings, and process enhancements.
- **Analyze supply chain performance over time**. Copilot can generate charts, graphs, and trendlines based on your data. Whether it's inventory turnover rates, lead times, or production volumes, these visual aids enhance your presentation's impact.
- **Create recurring presentations**. Operation managers may need to provide monthly updates, project status reviews, or process documentation. Copilot can standardize slide templates by suggesting consistent layouts, font styles, and color schemes. In doing so, Copilot ensures a professional and cohesive look for all your PowerPoint materials.
- **Create process flow diagrams**. You provide high-level steps, and Copilot generates the visual representation with arrows, decision points, and labels. These diagrams enhance clarity and understanding, especially when explaining complex operational processes such as order fulfillment, quality control, or logistics.
- **Incorporate industry-specific jargon into a presentation**. Operations managers often deal with industry-specific terminology. Copilot can suggest relevant jargon or acronyms based on context. For instance, if you're discussing Six Sigma methodologies, Copilot can provide definitions and explanations directly in your PowerPoint slides.

In the prior exercise, you used Copilot in Word to create a report comparing boiler versus furnace heating systems. In this exercise, you ask Copilot in PowerPoint to create a presentation based on that report.

### Exercise

As the Operations Manager at Adatum Corporation, you discovered the current boiler system that heats the company's 50-year-old office building requires significant repair, if not outright replacement. You feel that this moment may be the opportune time to convert your heating system from the existing boiler system to a more energy-efficient furnace system.

In the prior exercise, you used Copilot in Word to create a report identifying the differences between boiler and furnace heating systems. You now want to create a PowerPoint presentation based on this report that you can present to Adatum's senior management team. Your goal is to get them up to speed on the two types of heating systems, including the pros and cons of each, before you contact a Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) company and formally start this project.

1. If you have a Microsoft 365 tab open in your Microsoft Edge browser, then select it now; otherwise, open a new tab and enter the following URL: [**https://www.office.com**](https://www.office.com)
1. On the **Microsoft 365** home page, if **PowerPoint**  appears in the left-hand navigation pane, then select it now and proceed to the next step. Otherwise, select the **Apps** icon, and on the **Apps** page, select **PowerPoint**.
1. In **PowerPoint**, open a new blank presentation.
1. Select the **Copilot** icon that appears above the slide. In the drop-down menu that appears, select **Create a presentation with file**. 
1. In the **Copilot** window that appears, both a prompt field and a files window appear. You want to link the report that you created in the prior exercise to this prompt. Select into the prompt field, where it currently displays "**Create a presentation about /**". The forward slash is the universal Copilot indicator to enter a link to a file. After the forward slash (/), enter the first word of your report's file name. In the **Files** window that appears, select your file, which should appear in the list of files that start with the word you entered after the forward slash.
1. Note how the file appears in the prompt field. Select the **Send** icon in the prompt field.
1. Copilot in PowerPoint uses this information to generate a list of presentation topics. It doesn't generate the slides until you select the **Generate slides** button. Instead, it presents the topics first so that you can modify them, if necessary, before creating the slides.  
1. You can rearrange the order of the topics if you wish. Within each topic group is the main topic title and a list of subtopics. If you hover inside the topic area, a **Reorder Topic** icon appears to the left of the topic. Continue to hold down this icon and then drag and drop the entire topic section up or down in the list to move it to a different place in the presentation.
1. If you wish to remove a topic from the presentation, hover over the topic and then select the **Delete** (trash can) icon that appears. 
1. When you finalize the list of topics, select the **Generate slides** button.
1. Once Copilot finishes generating the slide presentation, it displays the slides in **Slide Sorter** view. In the PowerPoint ribbon, select **View**. In the **View** ribbon, in the **Presentation Views** group, note the **Slide Sorter** option is selected. Select **Normal** to view the slides in the traditional order. You're now free to review the slides and make any necessary updates. You can use the **Designer** tool to adjust the layouts. Select the **Home** tab and then select the **Designer** button, which appears to the left of the **Copilot** button. The **Designer** pane offers samples of different designs for the current slide being displayed. Change to a different slide in the presentation and note how the **Designer** pane generates different design options for that slide. Select one of the design options to have PowerPoint replace the current slide with the new design. This feature isn't Copilot-related. It's available in PowerPoint when you have a Microsoft 365 subscription, but it's nice to try it here if you have yet to use it.
1. Now let's see what else Copilot can do. Select the **Copilot** icon that appears above the slide. In the menu that appears, select **Ask Copilot** to open the **Copilot** pane.
1. By default, Copilot in PowerPoint doesn't generate speaker notes at the time it creates the slides. However, you can ask it during your initial prompt or after the slides are generated to add speaker notes to each slide. For example, now that the slides are created, enter the following prompt in the Copilot pane: **Add speaker notes to each slide**. 
    > [!NOTE]
    > It might take Copilot a couple of minutes to generate the speaker notes. 
1. Once Copilot responds that it added speaker notes, review the Notes pane for each slide. If the Notes pane doesnâ€™t appear, select the **Notes** option at the bottom of the page to display the Notes pane. Review the speaker notes that Copilot added to the presentation. Verify the notes call out the points that you want to make during the presentation.
1. Let's begin by adding an image to a slide. Find a slide without an image and enter the following prompt (don't forget to replace **[enter slide number here]** with the number of the slide you picked): **Add an image to slide [enter slide number here]**. **The image should contain a picture related to the slide contents**.
1. Rather than inserting an image directly into the slide, Copilot might display multiple images in the Copilot pane and ask you to select one. Select the image you want and then select the **Insert** button that appears below the images. When you do so, notice how Copilot inserts the image over top of the entire slide. You must manually adjust the image size and move it to an appropriate spot on the slide. 
1. You also notice that there isn't any content in the presentation related to the expected lifespan for each type of heating system. You want Copilot to research this topic and then add it into the presentation. Enter the following prompt: **What is the average lifespan of a boiler heating system versus a furnace heating system?**
1. You now want Copilot to add this content to a slide. Select the slide towards the beginning of the presentation that lists the types of boiler systems. Then enter the following prompt (don't forget to replace **[enter slide number here]** with the number of the slide you picked): **Add this lifespan content to slide [enter slide number here]**.
1. What did Copilot do? Did it do something like adding "**Lifespan content**" to the top of the slide, overlaying it on top of the existing content on the slide? Or did it do create a new slide just for this topic? If the prior prompt didn't work as expected, remove whatever was added to the slide. Now try it again, but this time ask Copilot to find the lifespan content and add it to the slide all in one prompt. This time, enter the following prompt: **Add content about the average lifespan of a boiler heating system versus a furnace heating system to slide [enter slide number here].**
1. Did this work better? In our testing, we received different results. Sometimes Copilot created a new slide following the slide number that we included in our prompt. Other times, Copilot added the following bullet that summarized the lifespan differences to the selected slide: **The average lifespan of a boiler heating system is around 15 years, while a furnace heating system can last up to 20 years. However, the actual lifespan of the system can vary depending on factors such as maintenance, usage, and quality of the system.**

    > [!NOTE]
    >  This example shows that sometimes you just have to rework your prompts if Copilot doesn't do exactly what you wanted.

1. You notice that there isn't a slide at the end for a Question-and-Answer (Q&A) session. To correct this situation, enter the following prompt: **Add a Q&A slide at the very end of the presentation with an appropriate image.**
1. Did Copilot create the new slide at the end of the presentation, or did it add it following the slide you updated in the prior step? If it didn't add the slide to the end of the presentation, then you must manually move it yourself. If this situation occurred, then it just shows that Copilot in PowerPoint is still a work in progress that may require further updates to fine tune its functionality.
1. Review the new slide that was created. Upon seeing this slide, you would like Copilot to create a list of possible questions and add them to the speaker notes for the Q&A slide. Enter the following prompt: **Create a list of five questions that may be asked during the Q&A session and add them to the speaker notes in the Q&A slide.**
1. How did Copilot respond when you tried this prompt? Did it add five questions to the speaker notes for the Q&A slide? If so, then congratulations! However, if Copilot added the questions to the slide itself rather than to the speaker notes, then cut the questions from the slide and paste them into the speaker notes yourself. Or, if Copilot generated a paragraph in the speaker notes explaining what the instructor can ask of the viewers, then try again by entering the following prompt: **You misunderstood. I didn't ask for a Q&A explanation. I asked you to create a numbered list of five potential questions that viewers might ask. Please provide this list and NOT a paragraph about the opportunity that a Q&A session provides. **
1. During testing, sometimes Copilot generated five Q&A questions, and other times it simply provided a paragraph that talked about how the Q&A session was an opportunity for open dialogue. If Copilot wouldn't create the list of five questions, just remember that it's still a work in progress. 
1. You can either discard this presentation or save it if you want to keep it for future reference.
