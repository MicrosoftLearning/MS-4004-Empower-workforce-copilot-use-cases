# Create a presentation comparing heating systems using Copilot in PowerPoint
---
Proficiency in using Copilot for PowerPoint is a strategic skill for professionals aiming to elevate the impact of their presentations. In the corporate world, effective communication through compelling slide decks is paramount - even in the world of Operations management. Copilot for PowerPoint serves as an intelligent collaborator, offering real-time suggestions and enhancements as Operation Managers craft their presentations. This tool not only accelerates the creation process but also ensures that the content is engaging, clear, and resonant with the intended audience.

Operations Managers may need to create PowerPoint presentations for various reasons. For example, they may need to:

 -  Report on operational efficiency improvements. Copilot can generate a succinct overview of key metrics, cost savings, and process enhancements.
 -  Analyze supply chain performance over time. Copilot can generate charts, graphs, and trendlines based on your data. Whether it’s inventory turnover rates, lead times, or production volumes, these visual aids enhance your presentation’s impact.
 -  Create recurring presentations, such as monthly updates, project status reviews, or process documentation. Copilot can standardize slide templates by suggesting consistent layouts, font styles, and color schemes. In doing so, Copilot ensures a professional and cohesive look for all your PowerPoint materials.
 -  Create process flow diagrams. You provide high-level steps, and Copilot generates the visual representation with arrows, decision points, and labels. These diagrams enhance clarity and understanding, especially when explaining complex operational processes such as order fulfillment, quality control, or logistics.<br>
 -  Incorporate industry-specific jargon into a presentation. Operations Managers often deal with industry-specific terminology. Copilot can suggest relevant jargon or acronyms based on context. For instance, if you’re discussing Six Sigma methodologies, Copilot can provide definitions and explanations directly in your PowerPoint slides.

In the prior exercise, you used Copilot in Word to create a report comparing boiler versus furnace heating systems. In this exercise, you ask Copilot in PowerPoint to create a presentation based on that report.

### Exercise

As the Operations Manager at Adatum Corporation, you discovered that the current boiler system that heats the company's 50-year-old office building is in need of significant repair, if not outright replacement. You feel that this moment may be the opportune time to convert your heating system from the existing boiler system to a more energy-efficient furnace system.

In the prior exercise, you used Microsoft Copilot to create a report identifying the differences between boiler and furnace heating systems. You now want to create a PowerPoint presentation based on this report that you can present to Adatum's management team. Your goal is to get them up to speed on the two types of heating systems, including with the pros and cons of each, before you contact a Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) company and formally start this project.

1.  If you completed the prior exercise and created a report comparing boiler and furnace heating systems, then verify that you copied it to your OneDrive account and proceed to the next step. However, if you were unable to create this report in the prior exercise, then select the following link to download a [Comparing boiler and furnace heating systems report](https://edxinteractivepage.blob.core.windows.net/ms-4004/Comparing%20boiler%20and%20furnace%20heating%20systems%20report.docx) that was created for you. Once the file finishes downloading, copy it to your OneDrive account.
2.  Open the report to verify that everything is in order, and then close the file. Doing so also ensures that it appears in the Most Recently Used (MRU) file list.
3.  If you have a Microsoft 365 tab open in your Microsoft Edge browser, then select it now; otherwise, open a new tab and enter the following URL: **https://www.office.com**
4.  On the **Microsoft 365** home page, select the **PowerPoint** icon in the navigation pane on the left.
5.  In **PowerPoint**, open a new blank presentation.
6.  On the right side of the PowerPoint ribbon, select the **Copilot** option.
7.  In the **Copilot** pane that appears, several predefined prompts are available for you to choose from. Select the **Create presentation from file** prompt.
8.  In the prompt field at the bottom of the **Copilot** pane, Copilot automatically enters the text: **Create presentation from file /**. The forward slash is the universal Copilot indicator to enter a link to a file. In this case, it triggers Copilot to open a **Suggestions** window that displays three of the most recently used files.
     -  If your file appears here, then select it now and proceed to the next step.
     -  If the file isn't one of the three being displayed, select the right arrow (**&gt;**) in the upper right corner of the **Suggestions** window to see an expanded MRU file list. If the file appears here, then select it now and proceed to the next step.
     -  If you don't see your file in the expanded MRU list, then you must copy the link to the report and paste it in the prompt field. To do so:
        1.  Select the **Microsoft 365** browser tab and select **Word** in the navigation pane.
        2.  In the **Word** home page, in the list of recent files, select the report to open it in Word.
        3.  In the report in Word, on the far-right above the ribbon, select the **Share** button. In the drop-down menu that appears, select **Copy Link**. Wait for the **Link copied** window to appear, which is your assurance that the link to the file was copied to your clipboard.
        4.  Switch to your **PowerPoint** tab, and at the bottom of the **Copilot** pane, the prompt field should still be displaying **Create presentation from file /**. Position your cursor after the forward slash (**/**) and then paste in (**Ctrl+V**) the link to the report.
9.  Note how the file appears in the prompt field. Select the **Send** icon in the prompt field.
10. This prompt triggered Copilot to create a slide presentation based on the document. In doing so, it first displayed the outline of the presentation in the Copilot pane. Then it displayed a separate window showing a bulleted list of some of the changes that it made to the presentation based on the document.
11. You're now free to review the slides and make any necessary updates. Pay special attention to the changes that Copilot made based on the document. You can use the **Designer** tool to adjust the layouts.
12. Review the speaker notes that Copilot added to each slide in the presentation. Verify they call out the points that you want to make during the presentation.
13. Try using Copilot to update the presentation. Let's begin by adding an image to a slide. Find a slide without an image and enter the following prompt (don't forget to replace \[enter slide number here\] with the number of the slide you picked):
    
    **Add an image to slide \[enter slide number here\]**. **The image should contain a picture related to the slide contents**.
14. You also notice that there isn't any content in the presentation related to the expected lifespan for each type of heating system. You want Copilot to research this topic and then add it into the presentation. Enter the following prompt:
    
    **What is the average lifespan of a boiler heating system versus a furnace heating system**?
15. You now want Copilot to add this content to a slide. Select the slide towards the beginning of the presentation that lists the types of boiler systems. Then enter the following prompt (don't forget to replace \[enter slide number here\] with the number of the slide you picked):
    
    **Add this lifespan content to slide \[enter slide number here\]**.
16. What did Copilot do? Did it do something like adding "**Lifespan content**" to the top of the slide, overlaying it on top of the existing content on the slide? Or did it do something similar? If the prior prompt didn't work as expected, remove whatever was added to the slide. Now try it again, but this time ask Copilot to find the lifespan content and add it to the slide all in one prompt. This time, enter the following prompt:
    
    **Add content about the average lifespan of a boiler heating system versus a furnace heating system to slide \[enter slide number here\].**
17. Did this work better? In our testing, Copilot added the following bullet that summarized the lifespan differences to the selected slide:
    
    **The average lifespan of a boiler heating system is around 15 years, while a furnace heating system can last up to 20 years. However, the actual lifespan of the system can vary depending on factors such as maintenance, usage, and quality of the system.**

    > **NOTE:** This example shows that sometimes you just have to rework your prompts if Copilot doesn't do exactly what you wanted.

18. You notice that there isn't a slide at the end for a Question-and-Answer (Q&A) session. To correct this situation, enter the following prompt:
    
    **Add a Q&A slide at the very end of the presentation with an appropriate image.**
19. Review the new slide that was created. Upon seeing this slide, you would like Copilot to create a list of possible questions and add them to the speaker notes for the Q&A slide. Enter the following prompt:
    
    **Create a list of five questions that may be asked during the Q&A session and add them to the speaker notes in the Q&A slide.**
20. How did Copilot respond when you tried this prompt? Did it add five questions to the speaker notes for the Q&A slide? If so, then congratulations! However, if Copilot kept adding the questions to the slide itself rather than to the speaker notes, then remember that Copilot is still a work in progress. If this occurs, then cut the questions from the slide and paste them into the speaker notes yourself.
21. You can either discard this presentation or save it if you want to keep it for future reference.
