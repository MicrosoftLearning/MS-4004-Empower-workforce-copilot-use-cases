# Exercise 1, Task 3: Use Copilot in PowerPoint to create an executive presentation
---
In the prior task, you used Copilot in Word to create the **Heating System Comparison** report, which identified the differences between boiler and furnace heating systems. You now want to create a PowerPoint presentation based on this report that you can present to Adatum's senior leadership team. Your goal is to get them up to speed on the two types of heating systems, including the pros and cons of each, before you contact a Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) company and formally start this project.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  In your Microsoft Edge browser, go to the **Microsoft 365** home page, select **Apps** in the navigation pane, and then select **PowerPoint** from the **Apps** menu.

2.  In **PowerPoint for the web**, create a blank presentation.

3.  In the Copilot menu that appears on the title slide for the blank presentation, select the **Create a new presentation with file** option.

4.  In the **Create a presentation with Copilot** window that appears, select the **Reference files** option and select the **Heating System Comparison** report that you stored in your OneDrive account in the prior task. Then ask Copilot to generate an executive leadership presentation based on the attached file.

5.  Copilot in PowerPoint uses this information to generate a list of presentation topics. It doesn’t generate the slides until you select the **Generate slides** button. Instead, it presents the topics first so that you can modify them, if necessary, before creating the slides.

6.  You can rearrange the order of the topics if you wish. Each topic group includes the main topic title and a list of subtopics. If you hover inside the topic area, a **Reorder Topic** icon appears to the left of the topic. Continue to hold down this icon and then drag and drop the entire topic section up or down in the list to move it to a different place in the presentation.

7.  If you wish to remove a topic from the presentation, hover over the topic and then select the **Delete** (trash can) icon that appears.

8.  When you finalize the list of topics, select the **Generate slides** button.

9.  Once Copilot finishes generating the slide presentation, it displays the slides in **Slide Sorter** view. In the PowerPoint ribbon, select **View**. In the **View** ribbon, note the **Slide Sorter** option is selected in the **Presentation Views** group. Select **Normal** to view the slides in the traditional order. You're now free to review the slides and make any necessary updates. You can use the **Designer** tool to adjust the layouts. To do so, select the **Home** tab and then select the **Designer** button, which appears to the left of the **Copilot** button.

10. The **Designer** pane offers samples of different designs for the current slide being displayed. Change to a different slide in the presentation and note how the **Designer** pane generates different design options for that slide. Select one of the design options to have PowerPoint replace the current slide with the new design. This feature isn't Copilot-related. It's available in PowerPoint when you have a Microsoft 365 subscription, but feel free to try it here if you haven't used it before.

11. Now let's see what else Copilot can do. There are two ways to use Copilot in PowerPoint:

    - If you select the **Copilot** button on the far-right end of the **Home** ribbon, the **Copilot Chat** pane opens. The Copilot Chat pane starts a chat with Copilot, but it generally can’t push changes directly into the slide deck. Instead, you must copy/paste from its responses.

    - The **Copilot** icon that appears above the first slide can directly change the open deck. For example, you can use this Copilot to add a slide or topic (a section with multiple slides) to the presentation.  
        

    Since you want to see whether Copilot can add an image to a slide, select the **Copilot** button that appears in the ribbon. Doing so opens the Copilot pane.

12.  Find a slide without an image. Then in the Copilot pane, ask Copilot to generate an image related to the contents of that slide number, and then ask it to add the image to the slide.

13.  It might take a minute or two, but eventually Copilot generates an image in the Copilot pane. However, as you can see, it didn’t add the image directly into the slide. Ask it again to add the image into the slide.

14.  What was Copilot’s response? It should respond by saying that it can’t directly insert images into your PowerPoint slide from this app (the Copilot pane). However, it does provide step by step instructions on how to add the image yourself. Due to time constraints, don’t bother adding the image.

15.  You also notice that there isn't any content in the presentation related to the expected lifespan for each type of heating system. You want Copilot to research this topic and then add it onto a specific slide. Ask Copilot what’s the average lifespan of a boiler heating system versus a furnace heating system?

16.  If Copilot’s response is a mix of bullets and text, ask it to summarize the content into a list of bullets that can fit on a slide.

17.  You now want Copilot to add this summarized bullet list to a slide. Select the slide towards the beginning of the presentation that lists the types of boiler systems. Then ask Copilot to add this summarized bullet list of lifespan content on to that specific slide number.

18.  What was Copilot’s response? It should respond by saying that it’s unable to directly edit or insert content into your PowerPoint slides from within the Copilot app. It probably recommended that you copy and paste the content into the slide manually. Due to time constraints, don’t bother adding the content to the slide.

19.  You notice that there isn't a slide at the end of the presentation for a Question and Answer (Q&A) session. If you recall from the earlier step, Copilot can add a slide into the deck, but to do so, you must select the **Copilot** icon that appears above the current slide. Select the last slide in the deck and then select this Copilot icon that appears above it. In the menu that appears, select **Add a slide**.

20.  In the **Add a slide with Copilot** window that appears, ask Copilot to add a Question and Answer (Q&A) slide after the final slide in the presentation. Since Copilot requires a topic for a new slide, tell it that the topic for the slide is “Q&A.”

21. Once Copilot generates the slide, you feel that it looks OK, so select the **Keep it** button. Did Copilot place the slide at the end of the deck? If Copilot placed the slide somewhere else, then drag and drop the slide to the proper location.

In this task, you asked Copilot to insert content and an image directly on to slides. Copilot generated the requested content, but it also indicated that it can’t place content or images directly in slide. It can’t do so because Copilot in PowerPoint currently works as a content-generation assistant, not a full editing engine. As such, it creates text, ideas, and design suggestions in the Copilot pane, but it doesn’t have direct write access to the slide canvas or the file structure. This design ensures user control over layout, branding, and compliance—Copilot suggests, and you decide what to apply. 

To use the output that Copilot generates in the Copilot pane, you must manually copy the generated text or image into your slide or use PowerPoint’s built-in “Designer” and “Insert” tools to finalize the changes. Adding a slide directly into the deck is a different situation. As you saw, Copilot can add a new topic or slide to the presentation.
