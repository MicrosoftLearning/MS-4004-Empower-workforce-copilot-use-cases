# Exercise 2, Task 3: Use the Ideas Coach agent to generate campaign ideas and a channel map
---
Now that TR-Pulse is launched and the town hall content is taking shape, Trey Research needs a coordinated communication strategy to keep employees engaged before, during, and after each quarterly event. Different employee groups—clinical staff, research teams, corporate teams, and remote workers—consume information differently and require messaging that reflects their unique roles, schedules, and communication preferences.

As the company’s Communications Manager, you must design a campaign framework that ensures messaging around TR-Pulse is consistent yet adaptable across channels. This process should include defining messaging pillars, planning delivery cadence, and ensuring tone and content resonate with each audience segment.

To support this work, you plan to use Copilot’s Ideas Coach agent to brainstorm campaign ideas, refine messaging approaches, and map communication channels to specific audiences. This agent can help you move quickly from abstract ideas to concrete campaign plans, giving you a repeatable structure that can be reused for future TR-Pulse cycles.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  On the **Microsoft 365** home page, under the **Agents** section in the navigation pane, select **All agents**. In the **Agent Store**, under the **Your agents** section, select **See more**. In the expanded list of **Your agents**, select **Idea Coach**.

2.  In the **Idea Coach** agent, tell the agent that Trey Research is launching TR-Pulse, a new quarterly communication experience focused on transparency, leadership connection, and employee engagement. TR-Pulse enhances company communication by introducing virtual town halls, recognition spotlights, progress updates, and an always‑available employee FAQ resource. Its goal is to reinforce a culture of openness where employees feel heard, informed, and valued—no matter their role or schedule. As Trey Research’s Communication Manager, you would like Copilot to create four campaign ideas with sample messages tailored to Clinical staff (on-shift; limited time), R&D labs (compliance-minded; detail-oriented), Remote staff (home-based; asynchronous). Each campaign idea should include a key promise, tone, and compliance considerations.

3.  Review the results. You feel these ideas are a good starting point, so ask the agent to take the campaign ideas and turn them into a practical two-week schedule. The goal is to make the ideas actionable by mapping them into a real calendar that shows timing, responsibilities, and content types. Show what happens each day (Monday–Sunday) and include:
    - Channel: Where the message appears (Teams, SharePoint, Digital Signage, Viva Engage).
    - Content Type: What kind of asset you plan to create (post, article, graphic, etc.).
    - Owner: The person responsible for creating or posting the message.

4.  While all this planning looks good, you would like to spice it up a bit. Ask the Idea Coach agent to create a visual concept for each idea.

5.  These concepts intrigue you, so ask the agent to create a mood board for each concept with fonts, imagery, and icon suggestions.

6.  Note the agent’s response. It can’t generate actual image files, but it can create detailed mood board descriptions with fonts, imagery styles, and color palettes so your design team can easily bring them to life.

7.  At this point, you’re not sure about the mood boards. They don’t really match the vibe you’re feeling, so you decide to return your focus to the campaign ideas themselves. You feel these campaign ideas look promising, so you want to include A/B message variants for two channels. In A/B testing, you create two different versions of the same message for each channel so you can test which one performs better. The idea is to experiment with tone, phrasing, or call-to-action to see which version gets more engagement (clicks, comments, likes).  
    <br/>So ask the Idea Coach agent to create two different versions of your message for Teams and Viva Engage. Change the tone, wording, or call-to-action of each so that you can see which one gets more engagement.

8.  Review the results. You’re now wondering how you can refine and measure these ideas. Ask the agent to recommend three engagement metrics that you can track for your A/B messages and describe how you would gather feedback using Viva Engage or Microsoft Forms.

9.  There are so many other ways in which you can use the Idea Coach agent to improve these campaign ideas. Select one or two of the following ideas to see what the agent does:
    - **Deepen ideation and strategy development**. Use Idea Coach to go beyond the initial brainstorm.
        - **Prompt for audience insights**. “What are the top three motivators or barriers for engagement among remote employees, and how could our messaging address them?”
        - **Ask for risk analysis or pitfalls**. “What communication missteps should we avoid when messaging to compliance-minded R&D teams?”

    - **Strengthen planning and execution skills**. Expand the calendar and workflow planning you already have.
        - **Multi-channel sequencing**. Build an integrated four-week rollout that links channels (for example, how a SharePoint article triggers follow-up Teams posts).
        - **Asset creation guidance**. Ask for content outlines or creative briefs for one or two deliverables (for example, “Draft a creative brief for the Viva Engage post on Week 1, Day 3”).

    - **Emphasize measurement and optimization**. Encourage evidence-based thinking.
        - **Ask Idea Coach for key performance indicators (KPIs)**. “Suggest measurable goals and KPIs to evaluate the campaign’s success on each channel.”
        - **Simulate insights**. “Based on typical Viva Engage metrics, estimate what engagement might look like for A/B message A vs. B.”

    - **Focus on message crafting and tone refinement**. Explore writing and creative variation.
        - **Ask for message rewrites**. Request specific tones, such as “friendly but authoritative,” “inclusive and inspiring,” and “concise and data-driven.”
        - **Cross-culture check**. “Adapt the message for a global workforce with varied time zones and cultural norms.”

    - **Collaboration and alignment.** Copilot can support teamwork.
        - **Create a communication alignment guide**. “Draft a one-page style and tone guide that all content creators can follow for TR-Pulse.”
        - **Brainstorm engagement activities**.“Suggest interactive elements to include in the town hall (polls, recognition moments, open Q&A prompts).”

    - **Creative extension or future planning**. Encourage broader thinking.
        - **Spin-off campaign**. “Based on TR-Pulse, propose a related initiative focused on employee recognition or innovation stories.”
        - **Scenario pivot**. “If the company shifted to a hybrid-first model, how should the messaging and cadence adapt?”

10. Finally, ask the Idea Coach if it can consolidate all the ideas that it generated thus far into a downloadable document.

11. Note the agent’s response. While it couldn’t generate the document, it did consolidate all of its ideas together in its response. If you want to save the results, you can select the **Copy response** icon at the end of the response and then paste the copied text into a blank Word document.
