### Exercise

Adatum Corporation is developing a new internal communications platform called Adatum Pulse. Pulse is designed to help large organizations streamline messaging, boost employee morale, measure engagement in real time, and enhance internal communication strategies across the company.

As a senior member of Adatum's Communications team, you're tasked with creating a strategic communication brief for the company's executive leadership team. This brief, which is part of a broader employee engagement initiative, should:

- Introduce the Pulse platform
- Outline its key features and benefits
- Highlight its alignment with Adatum's strategic goals
- Demonstrate its potential business value and impact

You plan to use Microsoft 365 Copilot in Word to generate an initial draft of the brief, refine the messaging for clarity and tone, and polish the final version to ensure it's professional, compelling, and aligned with leadership expectations. 

Perform the following steps to generate this communication brief using Copilot in Word:

1. Select the following link to open a copy of [Adatum Pulse Product Specification](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2320263). Select the **Download** button at the top of the screen to download the file to your computer.
1. Once the download is complete, open **File Explorer** and move the file from your **Downloads** folder to your **OneDrive - Microsoft** folder.
1. In this exercise, you access the document from the Most Recently Used (MRU) file list. To get the file to appear in the list, open the document and then close it.
1. In **Microsoft 365**, select **Word** if it appears in the left-hand navigation pane. If it doesn't appear there, then select **Apps** in the navigation pane, and on the **Apps** page, select **Word**.
1. In the **Word** file page, open a blank document.
1. In the **Copilot** prompt field that appears at the top of the blank document, enter the following prompt (do not select the **Generate** button at this point, since you must first attach the product spec document in the next step): **Draft a strategic communication brief introducing Adatum's new Pulse platform for the company's executive leadership team. See the attached product specification file for key details, features, and benefits. The brief should highlight the platform's strategic value, alignment with business goals, and potential impact on employee engagement**.
1. In the **prompt** field, select the **+Add content** button. In the drop-down menu that appears, the **All** tab is displayed by default. If the **Adatum Pulse Product Specification.docx** file appears, then select it. Otherwise, select the **Files** tab and then select the **Adatum Pulse Product Specification.docx** if it appears. If the file doesn't appear in either tab, then following the prompt, enter /adatum. Doing so opens the content menu, and the **Adatum Pulse Product Specification.docx** should appear in the **All** tab. Select the file. Note how the file is displayed in the prompt.
1. Select the **Generate** icon. 
1. At this point, Copilot extracts the benefits of the Pulse system from its product specification and creates the first draft of the communications brief. After reviewing the initial draft, you decide that it's a good starting point, although there are a few areas that you want to modify. The first thing you want to do is change the formatting of the benefits for each feature. Here's a couple of options depending on how your first draft appears.
   - If the benefits for each feature are displayed in a bulleted list, you want to see how they appear in a table format. In this case, enter the following prompt: **Rather than display the benefits for each feature in a bulleted list, display them in a table format**.
   - If the benefits for each feature are displayed in a table format, you want to see how they appear in a bulleted list. In this case, enter the following format: **Rather than display the benefits for each feature in a table format, display them in a bulleted list**. 
1. Review the results. After much thought, you decide that you prefer the bulleted list version, but you want Copilot to display the features and benefits in an accordion style (made up of expandable/collapsible sections). Enter the following prompt: Please change the formatting of the features and benefits so that they appear in an accordion style that consists of expandable/collapsible sections. Within each feature, display the benefits in a bulleted list.
1. Review the new draft that Copilot created. Hover over each Feature heading to see the down arrow (**Collapse Heading**) icon. Select this down arrow for a feature to verify that it collapses that feature. Select the up arrow (**Expand Heading**) icon to verify that it expands the feature. You decide that this draft is the version that you want to move forward with. 
1. Now that you have a base version that you're happy with, you decide that it needs one last piece of information. It just dawned on you that there's nothing in the brief related to change management and adoption strategy. These topics are natural and highly relevant for Communications professionals, especially in the context of launching a new internal platform like Adatum Pulse. To correct this omission, enter the following prompt: **Add a new section titled "Change Management & Adoption Strategy." Describe how the Communications team plans to support the rollout of the Pulse platform across the organization. Include plans for internal messaging, leadership alignment, onboarding campaigns, and strategies to drive employee adoption and engagement during the transition**.
1. Review the new section. While the section looks good, you're concerned about the tone of the brief, so enter the following prompt: **Insert a professional tone throughout the brief and ensure it's appropriate for C-suite readers**.
1. While you're pleased with the results, you're concerned that it might be too long for executive stakeholders. You decide to have Copilot shorten the brief. That way, you can compare this latest draft with a final shortened version to see which one you prefer. To generate one final draft, enter the following prompt: **Shorten the brief by 20% while keeping the key messages**.
1. Review this final draft. You can decide which version you want to use. If you prefer the longer version, select the back arrow in the Copilot prompt to go back to the previous version; otherwise, stay on this final, shortened draft. In the Copilot prompt field, select the **Keep it** button. The selected draft now turns into an actual Word document. 
1. At this point, you're no longer in Copilot draft mode. You have an actual Word document. However, you can still use Copilot to fine tune the document. While you're satisfied with the communication brief, you begin to wonder if it's missing critical information that Adatum's executive stakeholders might be looking for. You decide to have Copilot review the document and offer any suggestions. To do so, select the **Copilot** button that appears at the far-right side of the **Home** tab ribbon.  
1. **In the Copilot pane that appears, enter the following prompt: Review this strategic communication brief and identify any key information that may be missing or underdeveloped, particularly from the perspective of executive stakeholders. Consider whether the brief sufficiently addresses strategic alignment, measurable outcomes, implementation considerations, and leadership concerns. Suggest any sections or content that should be added or expanded**.
1. Note the list of suggested additions proposed by Copilot. You decide to include this information, but you remember that Copilot inserts new content at the current location of  your cursor. So in the document, place you cursor at a blank line below the section where you want the new content to appear. Then select the **Insert** button that appears below the list of suggestions in the **Copilot** pane. 
1. Review the new content that was inserted. Did Copilot copy and paste in the suggestions as they appear in the detail pane, which instructed you on what to include for each new suggestion? Or did it actually provide the information that it suggested you include? In our testing, Copilot copied and pasted the same text from the detail pane, which told us what to include. Other times it expanded a bit on the information under each section, but it went into more detail on what should be included. However, in neither case did it include that information for each suggestion. <br><br>
   If this scenario happened to you as well, the workaround would be to ask Copilot to create the text for each suggestion and then insert that into the corresponding section in the document. While we're not going to take up any more time in this exercise to do these steps, if you have time, feel free to give it a try. However, we did want you to see how Copilot sometimes operates. And always keep in mind the prompting best practice that you learned earlier in this training: If Copilot doesn't provide your desired results, you should iterate and adapt your prompts accordingly.
