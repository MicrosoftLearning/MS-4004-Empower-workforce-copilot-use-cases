# Draft an internal email announcement using Copilot in Outlook
---
Microsoft 365 Copilot in Outlook is transforming how Communication departments work by enhancing productivity, streamlining routine tasks, and elevating the quality of written communication. For professionals responsible for managing internal messaging, executive communications, press outreach, or crisis response, Copilot acts as a powerful assistant that helps reduce manual effort while improving clarity and impact.

One of the key advantages of Copilot is its ability to draft and refine emails quickly and intelligently. Communication professionals can input key points, and Copilot generates polished, professional messages that reflect the intended tone and structure. This feature is especially valuable when crafting emails on behalf of executives or when managing time-sensitive communications where both speed and precision matter. It can also adjust messages to suit different audiences, helping teams fine-tune internal memos, stakeholder updates, and media responses.

Copilot also excels at summarizing long email threads, making it easier to stay on top of complex conversations without wading through every message. This feature is useful for communications managers who are involved in multiple projects or stakeholder interactions at once. With Copilot, users can generate concise summaries, identify action items, and even draft responses based on the context of the conversation all directly within Outlook.

Additionally, Copilot's integration with the broader Microsoft 365 ecosystem allows communications teams to seamlessly pull relevant data from Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, or Teams conversations into Outlook. For example, when preparing a campaign status update, Copilot can extract key metrics from a report or summarize talking points from a meeting, streamlining the process of keeping stakeholders informed.

Ultimately, Microsoft 365 Copilot in Outlook empowers communication departments to work more efficiently, write with greater confidence, and maintain consistency across messaging efforts. By reducing time spent on administrative tasks and content generation, professionals are free to focus on strategy, storytelling, and audience engagement core aspects of effective communication.

In this exercise, you use Copilot in Outlook to draft an internal email announcement to all company employees.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Copilot scenarios in Outlook are only available on a user's primary mailbox. They aren't available on a user's archive mailbox, group mailboxes, or shared and delegate mailboxes that the user has access to. Microsoft only supports Copilot in Outlook on mailboxes hosted on Exchange Online. Additionally, Copilot in Outlook is only supported in Microsoft 365 work or school accounts and Microsoft accounts with specific email domains. It's supported through Microsoft 365 Copilot with your Microsoft Entra ID account and Copilot Pro with your MSA account. Any Microsoft account that uses a third-party email provider can still access Outlook, but it can't access Copilot features in Outlook.

Copilot can create multiple drafts of the same email, each with a different tone and length. You can then navigate through the various drafts by selecting forward and backward arrows until you find a draft version that you like. Copilot tells you which draft you're on, such as 2 of 5, 3 of 5, and so on. As such, you can select the forward or backward arrow to quickly return to a particular version.

As you review a generated draft, remember to keep in mind the following best practices that you learned in earlier training:

- Note the salutation at the start (Dear/Hello/Hi there, etc.) and the complementary close at the end (Sincerely/Best regards/Thank you, etc.). Are they in the proper tone for the target audience and the type of message that you want to send?
- Note the overall tone of the message. Is it too casual, too formal, or too direct for the type of email that you want?
- Note the length of the message. Is it too short, where it doesn't explain topics in sufficient detail? Or does it continue for too long, explaining items in too much detail given the target audience for the email? 
- Does the message explain items (especially technical items) in terms that are too simplistic or complicated given the target audience?

### Exercise

In this scenario, you take on the role of a Communications professional at Adatum Corporation. One of your many responsibilities is crafting internal messages requested by senior leadership that are designed to keep employees informed and engaged. Adatum is preparing to launch a new intranet platform called Adatum Pulse. Pulse is designed to improve internal communication, streamline access to resources, and foster greater collaboration across departments.

Your task is to write an email that must be sent to all Adatum employees that announces the upcoming rollout of Adatum Pulse. You plan to use Microsoft 365 Copilot in Outlook to assist you in drafting a clear, engaging, and informative message. You're provided with a product spec document outlining key features and benefits of the platform. Your goal is to extract the most relevant information from this spec and present it in a way that builds awareness, generates excitement, and encourages adoption of the new system. Think about tone, clarity, and how to tailor the message to a broad employee audience.

Perform the following steps to create the email using Copilot in Outlook:

1. Since you downloaded and used the **Adatum Pulse Product Specification** file in the previous exercise, it should appear in your MRU file list.
1. On the **Microsoft 365** home page, if **Outlook** appears in the navigation pane, then select it now. Otherwise, select **Apps** in the navigation pane, and then select **Outlook** from the **Apps** page.
1. In **Outlook**, select **New** on the ribbon to open a new email.
1. Select the **Attach file** option in the **Message** ribbon. In the drop-down menu, select the **Adatum Pulse Product Specification** file if it appears under **Suggested files**. Otherwise, select OneDrive and then in the list of files in your OneDrive folder, select the **Adatum Pulse Product Specification** file and then select the **Share link** button. Note how the file appears in the body of the email message. 
1. On the **Message** tab, select **Copilot** on the far right-side of the ribbon. In the drop-down menu that appears, select **Draft**.
1. In the body of the message, a **Copilot** window appears. Below the **What do you want this email to say**? prompt field is a list of **Suggested prompts**. These prompts apply to various email types that you can select from. Rather than using one of these suggested prompt types, you decide to enter the following prompt in the **What do you want this email to say?** field: **Draft a company-wide email announcing the launch of Adatum's new intranet platform, Adatum Pulse, which goes live next week. The tone should be upbeat and engaging. Focus on key features and benefits pulled from the attached product spec, but simplify the language so it's accessible and relevant to all employees not just technical staff. Highlight how Adatum Pulse should improve communication, make it easier to find information, and support better collaboration. Keep the message clear, concise, friendly, and professional**.
1. Select the **Generate** button that appears in the prompt field.
1. Review the email draft that Copilot generated. Below the message, Copilot displays a menu that allows you to **Replace**, **Insert below**, **Discard**, or modify the content in various ways. You feel that it might be better to format the benefits in a bulleted list rather than in paragraph form. To see how this format change would appear, enter the following prompt: **Rather than displaying the benefits of Adatum Pulse in paragraph form, please create a new draft that displays them in a bulleted list**. 
1. Review the Copilot draft. At the bottom of the draft window, note how Copilot indicates this draft is <2 of 2>. This message means you're looking at the second of two Copilot drafts. You can select the back arrow (<) to go back to the previous Copilot draft, which formats the benefits of Adatum Pulse in paragraph form. Upon further review, you prefer the paragraph form, so you decide to stay with draft <1 of 2>. Ensure that this draft is the one currently displayed.
1. After reviewing draft <1 of 2>, you realize that you forgot to include the link to a training video that the IT department created for employees. To remedy this omission, enter the following prompt: **Please add the following link to a video training session for employees**: [**https://adatum.com/intranet/pulse-training**](https://adatum.com/intranet/pulse-training)**. Encourage employees to watch the video over the course of the next week**. 
1. Note the fact that you were at draft <1 of 2> (where the benefits were in paragraph form) when you requested this latest change. As such, Copilot created draft 3 of 3 to include this training link and message. At this point, you have one final concern, which is related to Adatum's remote workers. You want the email message to ensure inclusivity and engagement. Therefore, enter the following prompt: **Update this email to make the tone more inclusive and engaging for remote employees. Emphasize how Adatum Pulse supports remote collaboration, improves access to information regardless of location, and helps remote workers stay connected to company updates and culture. Keep the message positive, clear, and relevant to a distributed workforce**.
1. At this point, you're happy with draft <4 of 4>, but you want to see how it would change when using a different tone and length. Scroll down to the bottom of the menu and select **Change Tone**. In the menu that appears, select **Direct**. Doing so triggers Copilot to generate a new draft of the email with a more direct tone. 
1. Review the Copilot draft. At the bottom of the draft window, note how Copilot indicates this draft is now <5 of 5>. Compare draft 5 with draft 4, which had the tone that you requested in the original prompt (friendly and professional). After reviewing draft 5 with its direct tone, you decide that the original tone in draft 4 is more to your liking. So if you're on draft <5 of 5>, select the back arrow to return to draft <4 of 5>.
1. Since you now understand how the Copilot draft system works, feel free to take a few minutes to make changes to the tone and length of the email. For example, change the tone to **Casual**. Does that tone lose the professionalism of draft 4? If so, which do you prefer? Then change the length to longer and shorter if you wish. 

     

     > [!TIP]
     > Each time before you change the tone or length, always go back to your preferred draft (whether it be draft 4 or draft 5) before making another change. That way the change is made using your preferred draft as the starting point. In doing so, you can compare the changed draft to your preferred draft.
1. After you finish making these tone and length changes using Copilot in Outlook, make a final decision on which draft you prefer. Make sure you're on that draft (either 4 of 5, or 5 of 5). You're now ready to convert this selected draft into the actual email. If an email doesn't include an attached file, the Copilot draft menu includes a **Keep it** option that would convert the selected draft into the actual email message. But if a file is attached to the body of the message, the menu displays an **Insert below** option instead. This option creates the email below the file. Since the Adatum Pulse product spec is in the body of the message, the **Insert below** option appears in the menu. Select this **Insert below** option now.
1. Note how the message appears in the body of the email. Also note that the **Copilot** draft window disappears. You're no longer in draft mode. At this point, you can manually review the email and make any changes that you desire. Once you insert a Copilot draft into your actual email, you must manually make any further changes yourself. You can't go back into Copilot draft mode with that message. At this point, there's a couple of final changes you want to make. 
    - First, you don't want to include the attachment in the email, so remove the Adatum Pulse product spec file. 
    - Second, before you send the message, you must add a **Subject** line to the email. You want Copilot’s help in coming up with catchy subject line, so select the Copilot option at the far-right of the Outlook ribbon on the **Message** tab. In the drop-down menu that appears, in the **Ask Copilot** prompt field, enter: **Add a catchy subject line to this email that is sure to grab each employee's attention**. 
1. Submitting this prompt opens the Copilot pane. In our testing, Copilot returned an error indicating that it doesn't yet support adding a subject line to the email. If you receive a similar error, then recall your prompting best practices of iterate and adapt. In this case, rather than asking Copilot to “add” a subject line to the email, you just want it to “suggest” a subject line. To do so, enter the following revised prompt:  **Please suggest a catchy subject line that's sure to grab each employee's attention**.
1. You're not too thrilled with Copilot's first suggestion, so rather than just have it suggest another single subject line, ask it to suggest five of them. Enter the following prompt: **Let's try again. This time, please suggest five catchy subject lines that I can choose from. Make sure they each grab the employees' attention**.
1. At this point in our testing, Copilot returned an error saying it didn't support this feature. So we tried entering the previous prompt (**Please suggest a catchy subject line that‘s sure to grab each employee’s attention**.), which worked before. However, it too returned this error. As we mentioned before, Copilot is still a work in progress, so sometimes these types of situations occur. At this point, we're calling it good and moving on. 
1. Hopefully this exercise gave you a good grounding in how Copilot in Outlook works so that you can apply what you learned your real-world Communication scenarios. Since you aren't sending this message, select the trash can (**Discard**) icon in the upper right corner of the email screen to delete this email, and then select **OK** to confirm the deletion.
