# Exercise 1, Task 1: Use Copilot in Word to develop a strategic communication brief
---
Boulder Innovations is developing a new internal communications platform called AuroraHub. It’s designed to help large organizations streamline messaging, boost employee morale, measure engagement in real time, and enhance internal communication strategies across the company.

As a senior member of Boulder’s Communications team, you’re tasked with creating a strategic communication brief for the company’s executive leadership team. This brief, which is part of a broader employee engagement initiative, should:

- Introduce the AuroraHub platform
- Outline its key features and benefits
- Highlight its alignment with Boulder’s strategic goals
- Demonstrate its potential business value and impact

You plan to use Microsoft 365 Copilot in Word to generate an initial draft of the brief, refine the messaging for clarity and tone, and polish the final version to ensure it’s professional, compelling, and aligned with leadership expectations.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  Select the following link to download the [**AuroraHub Product Overview.docx**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2347805) file. Once the download is complete, save the file to your OneDrive.

2.  In your Microsoft Edge browser, sign in to the **Microsoft 365** home page (https://www.microsoft365.com), select **Apps** in the navigation pane, and then select **Word**.

3.  In **Word for the web**, create a blank document.

4.  In the **Copilot** prompt field that appears at the top of the blank document, attach the **AuroraHub Product Overview.docx** file that you downloaded.

5.  Then enter the following prompt to create a communication brief:

   > [!NOTE]
   > For this first prompt, we’ve provided the text so you can see what an effective prompt looks like when it incorporates the four key elements discussed in the Introduction unit. You must write all remaining prompts in this exercise, but in doing so, you can use this prompt as a model to emulate.
    
   **I’m the Communications Manager for Boulder Innovations. The company is preparing to launch AuroraHub, a new internal communications platform designed to streamline messaging, increase employee engagement, and provide real-time insights into communication effectiveness across a large, distributed workforce. Using the attached AuroraHub Product Overview document as your primary source, draft a strategic communication brief for Boulder’s executive leadership team. The brief should:**
    
   **\- Introduce the AuroraHub platform and its purpose**
    
   **\- Clearly explain its key features and benefits**
    
   **\- Show how AuroraHub aligns to Boulder Innovations’ strategic goals and values**
    
   **\- Describe the expected business impact, including engagement, transparency, and communication effectiveness**
    
   **Write in a concise, professional tone appropriate for executive stakeholders. Organize the brief with clear headings and short sections, focusing on clarity, relevance, and strategic value rather than technical detail.**

6.  At this point, Copilot extracts the benefits of AuroraHub from the product overview and creates the first draft of the communications brief. The Copilot window at the bottom of the document indicates this version is draft 1 of 1. After reviewing this draft, you decide that it's a good starting point, although there are a few areas that you want to modify. The first thing you want to do is change the formatting of the benefits for each feature. Here’s a couple of options depending on how your first draft appears.

    - If the benefits for each feature are displayed in a bulleted list, you want to see how they appear in a table format. In this case, ask Copilot to display the benefits in a table rather than a bulleted list.

    - If the benefits for each feature are displayed in a table format, you want to see how they appear in a bulleted list. In this case, ask Copilot to display the benefits in a bulleted list rather than a table.

7.  Review the results. After much thought, you decide that you prefer the bulleted list version, but you want Copilot to display the features and benefits in an accordion style (made up of expandable/collapsible sections). Ask Copilot to change the formatting of the features and benefits so that they appear in an accordion style that consists of expandable/collapsible sections. Within each feature, it should display the benefits in a bulleted list.

8.  Review the new draft that Copilot created. Hover over each Feature and Benefits heading to see the down arrow (**Collapse Heading**) icon. Select this down arrow for a feature to verify that it collapses that feature. Select the up arrow (**Expand Heading**) icon to verify that it expands the feature. You decide that this draft is the version that you want to move forward with.

9.  Now that you have a base version that you’re happy with, you decide that it needs one last piece of information. You realized that there’s nothing in the brief related to change management and adoption strategy. These topics are natural and highly relevant for Communications professionals, especially in the context of launching a new internal platform like AuroraHub. 
<br/><br/>To correct this omission, ask Copilot to add a new section titled “Change Management & Adoption Strategy.” It should describe how the Communications team plans to support the rollout of the AuroraHub platform across the organization. Include plans for internal messaging, leadership alignment, onboarding campaigns, and strategies to drive employee adoption and engagement during the transition.

10.  Review the new section. While the section looks good, you’re concerned about the tone of the brief, so ask Copilot to change the tone of the brief to a professional tone that’s appropriate for C-suite readers.

11.  While you’re pleased with the results, you’re concerned that it might be too long for executive stakeholders. You decide to have Copilot shorten the brief. That way, you can compare this latest draft with a final shortened version from the prior step to see which one you prefer. To generate one final draft, ask Copilot to shorten the brief by 20% while keeping the key messages.

12.  Review this final draft. You can decide which version you want to use. If you prefer the longer version, select the back arrow in the Copilot prompt window to go back to the previous draft; otherwise, stay on this final, shortened draft. In the Copilot prompt field, select the **Keep it** button. The selected draft now turns into an actual Word document.

13.  At this point, you’re no longer in Copilot draft mode; you have an actual Word document. However, you can still use Copilot to fine tune the document. While you’re satisfied with the communication brief, you begin to wonder if it’s missing critical information that Boulder’s executive stakeholders might be looking for. You decide to have Copilot review the document and offer any suggestions. To do so, open the Copilot pane by selecting the **Copilot** button that appears at the far-right side of the **Home** tab ribbon.

14.  In the Copilot pane that appears, ask Copilot to review this strategic communication brief and identify any key information that might be missing or underdeveloped, particularly from the perspective of executive stakeholders.

15. Review Copilot’s response. When you work from the Copilot pane, Copilot can’t see the open document. It can access the metadata for the file, but not the full document body. To complete this request, copy the content in the brief and paste it into the Copilot prompt field. During testing, it usually took several minutes for Copilot to generate its response.

16. Review the list of suggested additions proposed by Copilot. Ask Copilot to draft the missing sections in executive-ready language.

17. Review the results. You decide to include this information, but you remember that Copilot inserts new content at the current location of your cursor. So in the document, place you cursor at a blank line below the section where you want the new content to appear. Then select the **Add to doc** icon (a square with a plus sign in it) that appears below the list of suggestions in the **Copilot** pane.

18. Review the new content that was inserted. Did Copilot copy and paste in the suggestions as they appear in the detail pane, which instructed you on what to include for each new suggestion? Or did it actually provide the information that it suggested you include? In our testing, Copilot copied and pasted the same text from the detail pane, which told us what to include. Other times it expanded a bit on the information under each section, but it went into more detail on what should be included. However, in neither case did it include that information for each suggestion.  
    <br/>If this scenario happened to you as well, the workaround would be to ask Copilot to create the text for each suggestion and then insert that into the corresponding section in the document. While we’re not going to take up any more time in this exercise to do these steps, if you have time, feel free to give it a try. However, we did want you to see how Copilot sometimes operates. And always keep in mind the prompting best practice that you learned earlier in this training: If Copilot doesn’t provide your desired results, you should iterate and adapt your prompts accordingly.

19. Make note of the file name as you plan to use this strategic communication brief in Task 4 when you ask Copilot in PowerPoint to create an executive-level presentation. You can close this tab in your Microsoft Edge browser.
