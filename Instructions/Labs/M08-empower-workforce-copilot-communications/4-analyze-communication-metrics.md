# Analyze communication metrics using Copilot in Excel
---
While Excel is traditionally seen as a tool for analysts and finance teams, Communications professionals can also unlock powerful capabilities using Microsoft 365 Copilot in Excel. From managing campaign performance to analyzing engagement metrics, Copilot acts as a smart assistant that turns complex data into clear, actionable insights without requiring advanced spreadsheet skills.

One of the most significant benefits that Copilot brings to communications work in Excel is data summarization and interpretation. Whether tracking email open rates, internal engagement with newsletters, or social media analytics, Communications teams often juggle large datasets. Copilot can instantly analyze trends, highlight key changes over time, and answer natural language questions like, "What was our highest-performing campaign last quarter?" or "Which channels had the most employee engagement last month?" These features enable teams to make informed decisions quickly and present data-backed strategies with confidence.

Copilot also helps simplify report creation. Rather than spending hours formatting spreadsheets or building charts manually, Communications professionals can prompt Copilot to generate visuals and summaries automatically. For example, a user could ask, "Create a summary table of monthly communication KPIs" or "Visualize our engagement metrics across departments using a bar chart." These features turn Excel into a more accessible and intuitive reporting tool, especially for people who arenâ€™t daily Copilot users.

Additionally, Copilot is a huge asset when collaborating across departments. Communications teams often collect and organize data from HR, IT, or executive leadership. With Copilot, users can quickly clean up inconsistent data, identify duplicates, or categorize open text responses from employee feedback. This streamlines workflows and ensures that reports are polished and professional before being shared internally or externally.

By helping Communications professionals work smarter with data, Microsoft 365 Copilot in Excel expands the team's ability to measure impact, optimize campaigns, and communicate value to stakeholders all without requiring advanced Excel knowledge. It brings the power of AI to a familiar tool, making strategic analysis and reporting faster, easier, and more effective.

To use Copilot in Excel, your data needs to be formatted in one of the following ways:

- **Excel table**. You can format your data as an Excel table. This method is often the preferred one as it allows for easier manipulation and analysis of data. When you format data as an Excel table (using the **Insert > Table** option), the data is organized in a structured way with named ranges, and Excel automatically applies specific features such as filtering, sorting, and easy referencing of columns. Doing so helps Copilot understand and work with the data more effectively.
- **Range data**. Copilot can still analyze and assist with data in a regular range, which is also known as nontable formatting. Copilot in Excel can generate insights, summarize data, create formulas, and provide suggestions. However, it might have more limitations in working with nontabular data, as there's no predefined structure like you get with tables. 

In this exercise, you use Copilot in Excel to analyze a spreadsheet that's formatted in an Excel table. This exercise demonstrates how Copilot can quickly turn raw data into actionable insight an essential skill for any modern Communications team.

## Exercise

As a Communications professional at Relecloud, part of your role is to assess how internal messages are resonating across the organization. One of your key responsibilities is managing the company's quarterly newsletter. Relecloud's Senior Leadership Team (SLT) asked you for a quick overview of how different departments are engaging with it specifically looking at open rates and click-through rates over the past quarter. 

- **Open rate**. Indicates whether people are seeing the newsletter. It tells you how many people opened your email out of the total number it was sent to. For example, if you send the newsletter to 100 people and 60 of them open it, your open rate is 60%. This rate helps indicate whether your subject lines or sender name are compelling enough for people to actually open the email.
- **Click-through rate**. Indicates whether people find the email interesting enough to click on what's inside (such as articles, videos, or announcements). For example, if 60 people opened the email and 15 clicked a link inside it, your click-through rate is 25% (15 out of 60). This rate tells you if people are engaging with the content rather than just opening the email.

In this exercise, you plan to use Microsoft 365 Copilot in Excel to analyze a dataset that breaks down your quarterly newsletter engagement by department. Your goal is to generate a clear, high-level summary that highlights trends, identifies which departments are most and least engaged, and offers insights that could inform future communication strategies. Rather than manually calculating averages or scanning the table yourself, you're going to use Copilot to instantly surface trends. Doing so saves time and helps you quickly understand which departments might need more support or different messaging strategies.

Perform the following steps to analyze your quarterly newsletter engagement using Copilot in Excel:

1. Select the following link to download the [Relecloud Quarterly Newsletter Click Rates spreadsheet](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2320266).
1. Once the download is complete, open **File Explorer** and copy the file from your **Downloads** folder to your **Microsoft - OneDrive** folder.
1. In this exercise, you access the document from the Most Recently Used file list in Excel. To get the file to appear in the MRU list, open the document and then close it. 
1. Open your Edge browser (if necessary) and navigate to the **Microsoft 365** home page by entering the following URL: **https://www.office.com**  
1. On the **Microsoft 365** home page, select the **Excel** icon in the navigation pane on the left. If the icon doesn't appear, select **Apps** in the navigation pane, and then select **Excel** from the **Apps** page.
1. In **Excel**, scroll down to the list of all files in the MRU list. The **All** tab is displayed by default. Select the **Relecloud Quarterly Newsletter Click Rates** file. This file is a prepared dataset that shows how each department engaged with Relecloud's internal newsletter over the past quarter. The data includes the number of emails sent, how many were opened, how many links were clicked, and the corresponding open and click-through rates. Copilot needs structured data to analyze, so having clean and complete information in Excel makes it easy to ask questions and generate insights.
1. With the spreadsheet open in **Excel**, select the **Copilot** option on the right side of the ribbon (if the ribbon isn't displayed, hover over the **Home** tab). Doing so opens the **Copilot** pane. 
1. You want Copilot to look for patterns and outliers in the data and to compare each department's performance to the overall average. So instead of using the predefined prompts that appear at the top of the Copilot pane, you decide to enter your own custom prompt to gather this information. Enter the following prompt in the prompt field at the bottom of the **Copilot** pane: **Summarize trends in this data and identify any departments with below-average engagement**.
1. Review the results of this prompt. Note the different actions that it suggests you perform. Also note the suggested prompts that Copilot created that appear above the prompt field. These prompts are based on your previous request. In our testing, prompts such as "Any suggestions to improve engagement in these departments?" and "Can you provide a detailed analysis for the Engineering department?" appeared. Select one or two of the prompts that appear in your Copilot pane and review the results. You can also select the **Refresh** icon that appears above the prompt field to generate a new set of suggested prompts. You can select this **Refresh** icon multiple times to see the full extent of suggested prompts. Select any of the prompts that are of interest to you. 
1. Since you need to report your findings to the SLT, you want Copilot to generate a short summary, so enter the following prompt: **Provide a short summary that I can submit to my leadership team regarding overall departmental engagement. Indicate the average open rate across all departments, the average click-through rate, and identify the departments with below-average engagements**.
1. **Review the Copilot-generated summary. If a suggested prompt appears below the summary that says Show data insights, then select it now. Otherwise, enter the following prompt: Show data insights**.
1. In our testing, Copilot generated a **Links clicked by Department** bar chart. What did your version of Copilot generate? If Copilot generated a chart for you, select the **+Add to a new sheet** button that appears below the chart. Doing so adds this chart to **Sheet 2** of this spreadsheet, which Copilot then opened for you. If Sheet 2 doesn't appear, then select the **Refresh** icon at the top of the page, next to the URL address bar.
1. Select the **Sheet 2** workbook tab. It should include the pivot table of data that pertains to the chart, along with the chart itself. Since you want to perform more analysis on the click rates, you must return to the sheet containing the spreadsheet data. Select the **Sheet 1** workbook tab. If the **Copilot** pane no longer appears, hover over the **Home** tab and select the **Copilot** button again. 
1. **You now want Copilot to refine your analysis by ranking departments based on their click-through rate. Doing so helps you focus on the departments that are doing especially well, or struggling. Recognizing top performers can help you replicate success, while identifying low performers gives you a clear starting point for improvement. Verify you're on Sheet 1 and then enter the following prompt: Highlight the top 3 and bottom 3 departments by click-through rate**.
1. Review the response. For each group, Copilot should provide conditional formatting rules to review and apply. At the bottom of the response should be an **Apply** button, which tells Copilot to apply the conditional formatting rules to the spreadsheet. Select the **Apply** button to see what happens. 
1. Review the results. Lastly, you now want to go beyond the data and ask Copilot to help you interpret the results and suggest next steps. You're looking for practical, strategic recommendations tailored to the underperforming groups. This step turns insights into action, helping you improve future newsletter performance and tailor communication to meet employees where they are. To do so, enter the following prompt: **Please provide some suggestions on how we can improve open and click-through rates for low-performing departments**.
1. Review the response. This step turns insights into action, helping you improve future newsletter performance and tailor communication to meet employees where they are. You determine that your analysis is complete given all the data that Copilot in Excel provided. Since Excel automatically saved your file, close your Microsoft Edge browser tab.
