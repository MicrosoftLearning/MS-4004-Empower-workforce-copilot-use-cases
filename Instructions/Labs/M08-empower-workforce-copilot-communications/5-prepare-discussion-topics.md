# Prepare discussion topics for a town hall meeting using Microsoft Copilot
---
Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat is a powerful productivity tool that helps Communications professionals streamline their workflows, make informed decisions faster, and manage information more efficiently all through a natural, conversational interface. By acting as a personal AI assistant that draws from emails, documents, meetings, and more, Copilot Chat empowers Communications teams to find what they need and act on it without jumping between apps.

One of the most valuable features of Copilot Chat is its ability to retrieve and summarize content across Microsoft 365. For example, instead of searching through inboxes, Teams chats, or SharePoint folders for key messages or documents, a Communications professional can ask, _"What did the VP of Marketing say in the last town hall about the new branding strategy?"_ or _"Summarize the latest feedback from the employee engagement survey."_ Copilot Chat quickly pulls relevant information from across the organization's data, saving time and reducing information overload.

Copilot Chat also helps with content planning and idea generation. Communications professionals can use it to brainstorm campaign themes, draft outlines for announcements, or generate lists of talking points. For example, a user might say, _"Give me five headline ideas for an internal newsletter about our sustainability efforts,"_ or _"Suggest messaging pillars for our product launch communications."_ Requests such as these can accelerate the creative process and provide a strong starting point for developing impactful content.

Another benefit is the ability to coordinate and manage projects more effectively. Communications teams often juggle multiple initiatives across departments. With Copilot Chat, users can ask questions like, _"What are the key deadlines in our Q3 comms plan?"_ or _"Summarize the Teams conversation about the intranet launch timeline,"_ giving them quick access to project details and action items without the need to dig.

By using Copilot Chat, Communication departments can work more strategically, reduce busy work, and stay focused on delivering clear, consistent, and timely messaging. It's like having a research assistant, content strategist, and project coordinator all in one available anytime you need support.

## Exercise

- Generating a polished 5-minute speaking outline that covers major wins, addresses employee feedback in a thoughtful way, and ends on a motivational note to keep teams energized for the next quarter. 

This exercise demonstrates how Copilot Chat can support high-level communications planning by turning scattered information into structured, presentation-ready content all through simple, conversational prompts.

1. After reviewing Copilot's response, you feel that it's a bit formal and not very engaging. To correct this situation, enter the following prompt: **Rephrase the discussion topics to be more casual and engaging for a virtual audience**.
1. After reviewing Copilot's response, you feel that it sanitized some of the discussion topics for areas of improvement in the employee survey. You want the discussion topics to be a little more transparent, so enter the following prompt: **In the employee survey section, please adjust the discussion topics for the areas of improvement so that they call out specific unfavorable percentages. I want employees to know that the company is being transparent with them and isn't afraid to face how bad employee responses were in the low performing areas. Make a note to this effect in the Closing Motivational Message**.
1. You want to make one last change. Given the low performing items, you want the Call to Action section to mention that management recognizes there are some serious issues that need to be addressed related to recognition and work-life balance. To make this update, enter the following prompt: **In the Closing Motivational Message, please adjust the discussion topics for the Call to Action to let the employees know that Fabrikam takes the low performing scores for recognition and well-being very seriously and plans to make these top priority items moving forward. Mention how important these two factors are to overall employee morale, production, and happiness**.
1. In a real-world scenario, you would copy and paste the generated responses to a Word doc. For this training exercise, you can just close the Edge browser tab.
