# Exercise 1, Task 4: Use Copilot in PowerPoint to create an executive presentation
---
With the strategic communication brief complete and external research in hand, Boulder Innovations’ executive leadership team now needs a clear, visual summary of the AuroraHub initiative. Executives possess limited time and expect succinct, decision-oriented content that highlights priorities, impacts, and next steps, rather than long-form documentation.

As the Communications Manager, you’re tasked with creating an executive presentation that brings together the work you completed thus far. This deck must clearly articulate:

- Why AuroraHub is being introduced now
- How it supports Boulder Innovations’ strategic goals
- What data and external trends support the initiative
- How the company plans to manage adoption and measure success

Rather than building the presentation slide‑by‑slide from scratch, you use Copilot in PowerPoint to accelerate the process. Copilot helps transform your written brief and research findings into a cohesive, leadership‑ready slide deck—organizing content logically, suggesting clear headlines, and keeping visuals focused on strategic takeaways.

This task demonstrates how Communications professionals can use Copilot not just to draft content, but to package and elevate that content into formats executives rely on for decision‑making. By the end of this task, you should have a polished presentation that leadership can use to align stakeholders, secure buy‑in, and move forward confidently with the AuroraHub launch.

1.  In your Microsoft Edge browser, go to the **Microsoft 365** home page, select **Apps** in the navigation pane, and then select **PowerPoint** from the **Apps** menu.

2.  In **PowerPoint for the web**, create a blank presentation.

3.  Select the Copilot icon that appears above the title slide for the blank presentation, and then select the **Create a new presentation with file** option.

4.  In the **Create a presentation with Copilot** window that appears, select the **Reference files** option and select the AuroraHub strategic communication brief that you created in Task 1 and the PDF summary (trend synthesis) that you created in Task 2, both of which were stored in your OneDrive. Then ask Copilot to generate an executive leadership presentation based on the two attached files. The presentation should cover the following topics: Title + AuroraHub purpose, External trends and implications, Internal engagement insights (summaries only; no raw charts), Launch plan and change management pillars, Safety messaging and mobile access, and Call to action for VPs and site leads.

5.  Copilot in PowerPoint uses this information to generate a list of presentation topics. It doesn’t generate the slides until you select the **Generate slides** button. Instead, it presents the topics first so that you can modify them, if necessary, before creating the slides.

6.  Copilot displays the slides within each topic. You were hoping to keep the number of slides to a minimum, for example, 6-8 slides. However, you noticed that Copilot generated multiple slides per topic, which made the presentation too long for your presentation. You want Copilot to generate a new presentation with fewer slides. To do so, select the **Edit prompt** (pencil) icon in the prompt field at the top of the page. Doing so enables you to edit the prompt. Leave the previous prompt as is, but at the end, add a sentence that asks Copilot to create one slide per topic.

7.  Review the results. In our testing, Copilot sometimes created only one slide per topic. Other times, it generated two slides for one or two of the topics. In either case, there were fewer slides than what it originally generated.

8.  You can rearrange the order of the topics if you wish. Each topic group includes the main topic title and a list of subtopics. If you hover inside the topic area, a **Reorder Topic** icon appears to the left of the topic. Continue to hold down this icon and then drag and drop the entire topic section up or down in the list to move it to a different place in the presentation.

9.  If you wish to remove a topic from the presentation, hover over the topic and then select the **Delete** (trash can) icon that appears.

10. When you finalize the list of topics, select the **Generate slides** button.

11. Once Copilot finishes generating the slide presentation, it displays the slides in **Slide Sorter** view. In the PowerPoint ribbon, select **View**. In the **View** ribbon, note the **Slide Sorter** option is selected in the **Presentation Views** group. Select **Normal** to view the slides in the traditional order. You're now free to review the slides and make any necessary updates. You can use the **Designer** tool to adjust the layouts. To do so, select the **Home** tab and then select the **Designer** button, which appears to the left of the **Copilot** button.

12. The **Designer** pane offers samples of different designs for the current slide being displayed. Change to a different slide in the presentation and note how the **Designer** pane generates different design options for that slide. Select one of the design options to have PowerPoint replace the current slide with the new design. This feature isn't Copilot-related. It's available in PowerPoint when you have a Microsoft 365 subscription, but it's nice to try it here if you’ve never used it before.

13. Now let's see what else Copilot can do. There are two ways to use Copilot in PowerPoint:

    - If you select the **Copilot** button on the far-right end of the **Home** ribbon, the **Copilot Chat** pane opens. The Copilot Chat pane starts a chat with Copilot, but it generally can’t push changes directly into the slide deck. Instead, you must copy/paste from its responses.

    - The **Copilot** icon that appears above the first slide can directly change the open deck. For example, you can use this Copilot to add a slide or topic containing multiple slides to the presentation.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Keep in mind that once Copilot generates the slide deck, it currently can’t update or edit any of the slides directly from requests in the Copilot pane. Instead, following initial slide generation, Copilot excels at slide augmentation, evaluation, and decision making.

14.  In looking at the current deck, you feel that the slide covering internal engagement insights could use a better graphic than the one that Copilot initially included on the slide. Select this slide and then ask Copilot to create a visual showing how AuroraHub connects leadership, frontline employees, and engagement data.

15.  Review the result. On the internal engagement insights slide, delete any current visual if it contains one. Then in the graphic that’s displayed in the Copilot pane, hover over the graphic and then select the **Insert (+)** icon that appears. The graphic should display inside the selected slide. Drag the graphic if needed to the desired location.

16.  After Copilot inserts the graphic, it displays the **Design Suggestions** pane. Select the X in the upper corner of the pane to close it and return to the Copilot pane.

17.  You also feel that the slide covering the launch plan could use a better. Select this slide and then ask Copilot to create an adoption timeline or phased rollout diagram.

18.  Review the result. On the launch plan slide, delete any current visual if it contains one. Then in the graphic that’s displayed in the Copilot pane, hover over the graphic and then select the **Insert (+)** icon that appears. The graphic should display inside the selected slide. Drag the graphic if needed to the desired location.

19.  Once again, close the **Design Suggestions** pane.

20.  Even though Copilot can’t directly edit a slide, it can review it. However, you must manually copy and paste the text from a slide into the Copilot prompt, since Copilot can’t read the slides directly. You’re particularly concerned with the **Unifying internal communications for Boulder Innovations** slide. Highlight and then copy **(Ctrl+C)** the text on the slide, then in the Copilot prompt, ask it if this text from the Unifying internal communications for Boulder Innovations slide is too text heavy for an executive level presentation? Then paste in the text from the slide **(Ctrl+V)**.

21.  Review Copilot’s analysis. At the end of its response, Copilot might display a suggested prompt that says something like “Please rewrite the slide content.” If you see a similar prompt, then select and submit it. If you don’t see this prompt, then manually enter it.


22.  Review the rewritten text. If you wish, you can copy the suggested rewrite from the Copilot pane and paste it into the slide.
