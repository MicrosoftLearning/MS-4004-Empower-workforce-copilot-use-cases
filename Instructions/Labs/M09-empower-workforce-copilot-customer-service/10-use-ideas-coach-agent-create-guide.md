Tailwind Traders uncovered a recurring customer service challenge: dealers often request troubleshooting for the same types of product issues—such as performance concerns, quality defects, setup difficulties, and compatibility questions. Currently, support reps craft responses on the fly, leading to inconsistent instructions, missing steps, and uneven quality in dealer guidance.

Leadership wants a standardized, step‑by‑step troubleshooting guide that can be shared with any dealer experiencing common issues across Tailwind’s product lines. This guide should:

- Provide a clear sequence of steps for dealers to follow
- Include quick tests, evidence requests, and common remedies
- Help reps diagnose when a replacement or escalation is required
- Maintain a professional, concise, dealer‑friendly structure
- Be easy to update or adapt for different product types

Instead of manually designing this guide from scratch, you plan to use Copilot’s Ideas Coach agent to generate the structure, breakdowns, and troubleshooting steps. Ideas Coach excels at turning vague concepts into organized, actionable frameworks—perfect for a troubleshooting guide.

You then plant to save and refine the output into a reusable Word document (or any format you choose). Doing so should help ensure Tailwind’s dealers receive clear, professional, and consistent troubleshooting instructions, improving their ability to resolve issues efficiently, and reducing follow‑up workload for your support reps.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  Open **Microsoft 365** and in the navigation pane, under the **Agents** section, select **All agents**. In the **Agent Store**, under the **Your agents** section, select **See more**. In the expanded list of **Your agents**, select **Idea Coach**.

2.  In the **Idea Coach** agent, let it know that you’re the Customer Service Manager at Tailwind Traders, a specialty outdoor‑equipment manufacturer with a large B2B dealer network. Ask it to create a dealer-facing troubleshooting guide for the company’s product lines. The language should be concise and professional for B2B readers. The guide should include:

    - A step-by-step triage flow that dealers can follow. 
    - Quick diagnostic tests for common issue types.
    - A checklist of evidence that dealers must provide. 
    - Clear pass/fail criteria for each step. 
    - Common resolutions and temporary workarounds. 
    - Escalation rules and next steps.

3.  Review the agent’s response. It might lay out the framework for a troubleshooting guide and follow it up with several suggested prompts. Tell the agent that you want it to create a general template that applies across all product lines.

4.  At this point, you should have a good foundation for the troubleshooting guide. You now want to expand content in the guide using iterative prompting. After the agent responds to each request, it might ask if you want to combine the responses into one, all-encompassing document. You don’t want to do that until the very end, so ignore those questions until then.  
    <br/>To begin, ask the Idea Coach to expand the triage flow into separate tracks for performance issues, quality and defect issues, safety concerns, and usability and setup problems. It should include decision points and “if/then” logic.

5.  Review the results. If everything looks OK, ask the agent to create an evidence checklist that dealers must provide before troubleshooting can begin. The checklist should include photos, proof of purchase, serial number photo, environment details, and an optional short video.

6.  Review the results. If everything looks OK, ask the agent to provide three quick diagnostic tests that dealers can run for each of the following categories: performance, quality, safety, and usability. Make each test clear and short.

7.  Review the results. If everything looks OK, ask the agent to add escalation triggers and instructions that dealers should follow when an issue can’t be resolved. Include safety escalations, repeated failures, out-of-box defects, and warranty escalations.

8.  Review the agent’s response. It generated a significant amount of content, so creating something visual to accompany it might be beneficial to dealers. Ask the agent to create a visually structured flowchart for the triage process, which you can include with the steps it already defined.

9.  While the flowchart looks fine, it would be better if it was colorized. Ask the agent to add icons and suggested color coding for each step to make it visually appealing. For example, the color code should show: Green for PASS paths, Red for FAIL paths, and Blue for mandatory steps.

10.  Review the results. If everything looks OK, you’re now ready to package all the ideas into a single, shareable guide. Ask the agent to organize all the generated ideas into a clean outline suitable for a dealer-facing troubleshooting guide.

11.  Review the results. In our testing, the agent didn’t include all the ideas that it previously generated. Instead, it created what appeared to be more of an outline. If this situation happens to you, ask it to expand the outline into a full handbook structure with detailed content for each section that includes all the ideas that it previously generated.

12. During our testing, Copilot failed to include the color codes in the flowchart for the triage tracks. If the same thing happened to you, tell Copilot that it failed to include the color codes in the flowchart for the triage tracks. Ask it to include the color coding in this all-up document.

13. While the color coding looked good, there was one issue the agent needed to fix. In our testing, in the final version of the guide that included the color coding, many of the sections didn’t include the actual content. Instead, it displayed “Same as before” followed by a short description of the content in that section. The problem with this situation is that if you select the **Copy** icon at the end of the response (in order to paste the guide into a Word document), the content includes this “Same as before” statement rather than the actual content.  
    <br/>If this situation happened to you, tell the agent that you’re satisfied with this final version of the troubleshooting guide, but that it MUST replace all the “Same as before” statements with the actual content so that you can copy and paste the content into a Word document.

14. Feel free to follow up on any of the suggested ideas presented by the agent. Copy the outline and paste it into a Word document. Add headings and formatting as desired.

    > [!TIP]
    > When you paste the copied content into a blank Word document, right-click in the document and select the paste option that says **Keep Source Formatting**. Selecting this paste option keeps the color coding in the document. You lose the color coding if you select **Ctrl+V** to paste the content.

15.  In a real-world scenario, you could now use Copilot’s Writing Coach to polish the Word document into a clean, professional troubleshooting guide for Tailwind’s dealer network. We’re going to skip this step since you did something similar in the prior task using the Writing Coach, so you should be familiar with how it works and the benefits it provides.
