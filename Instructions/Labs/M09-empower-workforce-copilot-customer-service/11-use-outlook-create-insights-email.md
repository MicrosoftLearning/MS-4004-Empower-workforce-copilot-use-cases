Tailwind Traders’ leadership team recently emphasized the need for better visibility into customer‑resolution trends across the dealer network. Each week, dozens of product inquiries, warranty submissions, troubleshooting requests, and quality concerns flow into the support department. These interactions contain valuable signals, such as recurring failure points, emerging quality trends, seasonal surges, and training gaps. However, much of the insight remains buried in individual tickets or conversations.

To support better decision‑making at the leadership level, your manager asked you to send a concise email summarizing what happened across support over the past three months. The email should include:

- Trends in product issues and warranty claims
- Notable escalations or dealer frustrations
- Emerging patterns that might require investigation from Product or Engineering
- Recommendations for next steps
- Any training opportunities for support agents or dealer partners

You plan to use Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat to perform the initial analysis and create an email, which you then plan to polish using Copilot in Outlook. Copilot Chat can synthesize your uploaded summaries, call notes, or internal documentation into a structured report with a professional tone. From there, you can further refine the message using Copilot in Outlook before sending it to leadership.

By creating a consistent insights email, you can help Tailwind Traders move from reactive problem‑solving to proactive, data‑guided improvements. The company's goal is for this transition to result in higher dealer satisfaction and stronger product feedback loops.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  Select the following link to download the **TailwindTraders_SupportCaseSummaries.docx** file. Store the file in your OneDrive.

2.  In your Microsoft Edge browser, navigate to the Microsoft 365 home page.

3.  In the Copilot Chat window, attach the **TailwindTraders_SupportCaseSummaries** file in the prompt field.

4.  Then ask Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat to review the support case summaries in the attached file and draft a support‑insights email for Tailwind Traders' executive leadership. Include top issue themes, customer sentiment, dealer escalation patterns, and recommended next actions. Don’t list specific case numbers.

5.  We experienced two scenarios during testing:

    - Copilot sometimes created the email and notified you at the end of its response that the draft was loaded into Outlook as a new email. It then displayed an **Edit in Outlook** button that would open the email in Outlook.

    - Other times, it created the contents for an email, but it didn’t load the contents into Outlook as a new email. We had to ask it to turn the contents into an Outlook draft, after which it displayed the **Edit in Outlook** button.

    In either scenario, select the **Edit in Outlook** button once it appears. Doing so opens **Outlook on the web**.

6.  In **Outlook on the web**, the email that Copilot Chat generated is displayed.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > In this scenario, where Copilot Chat created the email and opened it in Outlook, Copilot doesn’t open the email in draft mode. Instead, it displays its response directly within the body of the email. After that, you must highlight the specific text you want Copilot to modify, whether that’s a sentence, a paragraph, or the entire email.

7.  After reviewing the email, you feel the first paragraph could be improved upon. To do so, highlight the first paragraph of the email (drag your cursor so that the entire opening paragraph is highlighted). Notice the **Open Copilot** (pencil) icon that appears. Select the icon to open the Copilot window.

8.  The Copilot window includes a prompt field and a menu of editing options. Since you highlighted the opening paragraph, select the **Auto Rewrite** option. Notice how Copilot doesn’t insert the revision directly into the email. Instead, it displays a Copilot refinement window containing a draft of the revised content. Also notice the menu options that now appear below the refinement window. You can either:
    - Replace the highlighted text with the revised text
    - Insert the text below the highlighted text
    - Discard the rewritten text

    In this case, select the **Replace** option. Notice how the first paragraph that you highlighted is replaced with the revised text.

9.  Now let’s add a new section to the email. You want this section to appear near the end of the email, after the **Recommended Actions** section. In the email, select the blank line that appears after the **Recommended Actions** section, since this location is where you want the new section to appear. Then select the **Open Copilot** icon that appears.

    > [!WARNING]
    > When you select the **Open Copilot** icon, take notice of what Copilot does. If it highlights the entire email, then once it adds the section that you request, it displays the entire email in the Copilot refinement window. The new section should appear where you selected. In this case, select the **Replace** option to replace the entire email. Alternatively, it might not highlight the entire email, and in the Copilot refinement window, it only displays the line that appears before the new text, followed by the new text, and then the line that appears after the new text. In this scenario, you would select the **Insert below** option to insert the new text below the blank line that you selected.

10.  In the prompt field, ask Copilot to add a section titled **Risks and Dependencies**. This section should include a short paragraph calling out what items could negatively affect support performance or customer satisfaction if they aren't addressed.

11.  Finally, let’s see what happens when you ask it to change the tone of the email. Select in the body of the email to highlight the entire email, then select the **Open Copilot** icon. Note one of the menu choices is **Change Tone**, which provides four options: **Direct**, **Casua**l, **Formal**, and **Like a poem**. In this case, instead of selecting one of these options, you want to submit a prompt request asking for something different. In the prompt field, ask Copilot to make the tone of the email more executive-friendly.

12.  Scroll through the contents of the Copilot refinement window to see how Copilot rewrote the email, giving it a more executive-friendly tone. If you don’t like this version, then select **Discard** in the Copilot window. For this email, select **Replace** to accept the changes.

13.  If you have time, feel free to play around with the various Copilot options when you select the **Open Copilot** icon.
