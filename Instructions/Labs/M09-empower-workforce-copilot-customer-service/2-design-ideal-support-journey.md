# Design the ideal support journey using Copilot in Whiteboard
---
Microsoft Whiteboard has long been a useful space for teams to brainstorm, sketch ideas, and visualize workflows. However, with Copilot now integrated, it becomes a powerful tool for structured, collaborative problem-solving. For Customer Support professionals, Copilot in Whiteboard offers a new way to map out service experiences, align across teams, and develop shared understanding of complex issues, all within a highly visual and interactive environment.

Instead of starting with a blank canvas, support teams can prompt Copilot to generate frameworks like customer journey maps, escalation workflows, and troubleshooting paths. Copilot can help break down a service process step-by-step, suggest where common issues arise, and even recommend improvements based on user input. Because it's collaborative, teammates from Support, Product, or IT can contribute live moving elements, adding notes, and refining ideas as a group.

By using Copilot in Whiteboard, customer service teams can shift from reactive issue handling to proactive service design. Whether you're planning improvements to the support experience, building out escalation paths, or visualizing a client onboarding journey, Whiteboard helps make those conversations more productive, and Copilot ensures you never start from zero.

## Exercise

As the Customer Service Manager at Contoso, you're tasked with leading a strategic initiative to design the ideal client support experience. Rather than focusing on documenting the current process, this effort begins with a clean slate. Your goal is to collaboratively envision what a seamless, efficient, and customer-centric support journey should look like from start to finish. Leadership wants to challenge assumptions and break free from legacy workflows that may be contributing to client frustration and internal inefficiencies.

To facilitate this work, you're using Microsoft 365 Copilot for Whiteboard to lead a highly visual, team-driven planning session. Your plan is to use Copilot to jumpstart the structure of the ideal support journey from the initial moment a customer encounters an issue, all the way through resolution and feedback. Together with your team, your goal is to identify each key stage, assign ownership, highlight potential pain points, and begin layering in improvements. The Whiteboard becomes a shared canvas where cross-functional perspectives can come together in real time, enabling rich conversation and alignment.

By the end of this session, you aim to have a clear, visually engaging journey map that reflects Contoso's aspirational support model. This artifact should serve not only as a design blueprint for process enhancements but also as a communication tool to align stakeholders and spark broader transformation across the customer service organization.

Perform the following steps to identify the ideal support journey at Contoso:

1. Open your Microsoft Edge browser (if necessary) and navigate to the **Microsoft 365** home page by entering the following URL: **https://www.office.com**  
1. On the **Microsoft 365** home page, select the **Whiteboard** icon if it appears in the navigation pane on the left. Otherwise, select **Apps** in the navigation pane, and then select **Whiteboard** from the **Apps** page.
1. On the **Whiteboard** page, select **+New Whiteboard**. 
1. On the menu bar at the top of the page, select the **Whiteboard** drop-down arrow. In the **Board name** field, enter **Contoso's ideal customer support journey** and then select the checkmark icon.
1. On the new **Whiteboard** page, if the Copilot menu appears above the **Copilot** icon, then select the **Suggest** option. If the menu doesn't appear, then select the **Copilot** icon, and in the menu that appears, select **Suggest**.
1. In the **Suggest content with Copilot** window, enter the following prompt: **I'm the Customer Service Manager at Contoso. Map out the ideal customer support journey for Contoso, from the client's initial issue to final resolution**.
1. By default, Copilot generates ideas in groups of six. In the **Suggest content with Copilot** window that appears, note the first six ideas that it generated. Copilot gives you two options here - you can either attach the ideas to your whiteboard if you're satisfied with the suggestions, or you can have Copilot generate more suggestions. Notice how the **Insert (6)** button indicates the number of ideas that Copilot generated - in this case, six. While six suggestions are a good starting point, you want to dig deeper into the steps required for the ideal customer service journey, so select the **Generate more** button. Note how Copilot generated another six ideas, so the **Insert (12)** button now displays **12**. While you can keep generating more ideas to get more granular suggestions, for the sake of time during this training exercise, let's insert the 12 ideas currently presented. Select the **Insert (12)** button.
1. When you select the **Insert (12)** button, Copilot attaches the suggested ideas to your whiteboard in the form of yellow sticky notes. As with a real-world brainstorming session involving actual sticky notes, you can edit a particular note, delete it, lock it from future removal, and so on. In Microsoft Whiteboard, these activities are supported through standard whiteboarding functionality. If you aren't familiar with Whiteboard, try selecting (double-clicking) a specific note, and then in the menu bar that appears above it, you can select the **Edit text** (pencil) icon or any of the other options. Selecting the ellipsis icon at the end of the menu bar displays a menu of more options, such as deleting the note. Again, the idea behind Microsoft Whiteboard is to mimic real-world sticky-note exercises. Feel free to edit one or more notes as you wish.
1. Now that you completed all the edits that you want done to the notes, you want Copilot to organize the notes by category. Copilot determines the names of the categories and automatically organizes the notes accordingly. Select the **Copilot** icon at the bottom of the page and then select **Categorize** from the menu. Note how Copilot selects the sticky notes by placing them in a box. Select the **Categorize** button in the **Categorize selected notes** window.
1. Note what happened. Copilot generated a set of categories and reorganized the notes accordingly. Each category of notes was assigned a different color to help identify the differences between categories. If the rectangle containing the notes isn't as large as it can be and still fit your screen, select the **Fit to Screen** icon on the bottom-right corner of the page. Doing so increases the size of the image until it can no longer increase it anymore without it exceeding the screen size.
1. Note the icon tray that appears below the organized group of notes. If you aren't satisfied with the categories, select the **Regenerate** button on the icon tray that appears.

    > [!TIP]
    >  You can select the **Regenerate** button as many times as needed until you're satisfied with the categories that Copilot provides. Select this button several times and note the changes that Copilot makes each time. Besides changing category names and relocating notes, Copilot may add or reduce the number of categories with each regeneration.

1. After regenerating the categories several times, you're not sure which iteration you liked best. While Copilot doesn't currently support going back to a previous categorization, it does allow you to start over. Select the **Revert** button to return to the starting list of 12 yellow sticky notes.
1. To categorize the sticky notes once again, select the **Copilot** icon at the bottom of the page and then select **Categorize** from the menu. In the **Categorize selected notes**? window, select the **Categorize** button.
1. Now that you know how the **Regenerate** button works, for the sake of time, select it once or twice if necessary until you're satisfied with the results. 
1. You now decide that you want Copilot to suggest common pain points for each stage. To do so, select the **Copilot** icon at the bottom of the page and then select **Suggest** from the menu. In the Suggest content with Copilot window that appears, enter the following prompt: **Suggest common pain points that customers might encounter within each category of the ideal customer support journey**.
1. In the **Suggest content with Copilot** window that appears, Copilot once again provides six suggestions. You know from experience that there's more pain points than just these items, so select the **Generate more** button. In fact, select it twice so that there are 18 suggestions. At this point, select the **Insert (18)** button. 
1. Note how the block of 18 pain point notes is highlighted with a line around the block. This block of notes is known as a note grid. You can move or resize a note grid just like any other element on your whiteboard. In this case, the note grid is overlaying on top of the categorized note grid. Since the pain point grid is selected, move it to the side by selecting the right arrow (>) several times until the entire block of pain point notes is no longer overlaying on top of the categorized notes. If you run out of space on the screen and part of the block falls off the screen, select the **Fit to Screen** icon on the bottom-right corner of the page.
1. You realize that you would like a short summary of this session added to your whiteboard content. To do so, select the **Copilot** icon at the bottom of the page and then select **Summarize** from the menu. Copilot generates a short summary of the main themes from this whiteboarding session. Scroll down to review the entire **Summary** window. You're happy with the results, so select **Keep it**.
1. Select the **Fit to Screen** icon on the bottom-right corner of the page to fit all the sticky notes and the session summary onto the entire screen.
