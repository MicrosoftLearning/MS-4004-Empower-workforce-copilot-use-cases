# Prepare for a client meeting using Copilot in Teams
---
Microsoft Teams is already the central hub for daily communication and collaboration in many support organizations but with Copilot built into Teams, it becomes a strategic partner that helps Customer Support professionals stay informed, prepared, and aligned. Copilot in Teams can quickly surface key insights from chats, summarize meetings, and even help draft content for follow-ups or internal briefings all without leaving your workflow.

For Customer Support teams juggling fast-moving conversations, client escalations, and ongoing issue tracking, Copilot is helpful in gathering context across multiple channels. It can pull together recent discussions, highlight recurring concerns, and help you prepare for meetings with customer success, technical teams, or leadership. Instead of digging through threads or taking notes manually, support professionals can rely on Copilot to generate clean, focused summaries and action lists that keep everyone on the same page.

Using Copilot in Teams means support teams can spend less time on information gathering and more time on client solutions and strategic coordination. Whether you're preparing for a sync with a key account team or debriefing after a high-priority incident, Copilot ensures that no detail gets lost and that next steps are always clear.

## Exercise

The Customer Service Manager at Relecloud is preparing for a sync meeting with the company’s Client Success Team to discuss ongoing support issues raised by a high-profile account: Contoso, Inc. Over the past month, Contoso surfaced several concerns through support tickets, chat conversations, and internal meeting notes. Contoso’s leadership recently reached out to Relecloud to ensure there’s a coordinated plan to address their concerns. With limited time and multiple data sources to review, the Customer Service manager wants to quickly gather information what Contoso is experiencing and present an organized summary to help the Success Team respond proactively.

To streamline this prep work, Relecloud’s Customer Service Manager plans to use Copilot in Microsoft Teams to analyze recent conversations and summarize key trends. Copilot can surface the top recurring issues, suggest action items for the upcoming meeting, and even help generate a brief agenda. Instead of manually digging through threads and notes, the Customer Service manager can focus on strategic insights and ensure everyone walks into the meeting aligned and informed. The goal of this meeting is to have a productive discussion that results in clear next steps for improving Contoso’s experience with Relecloud support.

>  This course doesn't include a Microsoft 365 lab tenant with fictitious data. Instead, you must complete this training exercise using your own personal data.

While your own personal data obviously can't support the situation described in this Relecloud scenario, let's look closely at what Relecloud's Customer Service manager wanted to accomplish:

- Identify top recurring issues.
- Suggest topics for an upcoming meeting.
- Generate a meeting agenda.

Copilot Chat in Teams can help everyone address these types of common tasks, regardless of their specific scenario. Because you don’t have a Relecloud tenant, you must use your own personal data to accomplish similar tasks. In this training exercise scenario, you should use Copilot Chat in Teams to summarize the emails, meetings, and chats regarding an actual topic in your work environment. This scenario is a common task for Customer Service professionals. When Copilot Chat synthesizes your data in this manner, it reaches across your Microsoft 365 tenant to gather this information.

Think of an actual project that you participated in over the past 30 days. Chances are, you received an almost endless number of emails, not to mention all the meetings and virtual discussions that you participated in. You're feeling a bit overwhelmed as you struggle to remember all the key points that were covered in all these different communication threads. If only there was an AI tool that could synthesize all your communication history and provide a concise recap of all activity for a given thread. And then it dawns on you.

You remember hearing about a Microsoft 365 Copilot feature that was added to Microsoft Teams. It can review all your communication activity across both Outlook and Teams, provide a summation of that activity, and determine the action items that you're responsible for. You decide to take advantage of this Copilot Chat in Teams feature to save you the time and effort needed to manually review all your communication activity.

Perform the following steps using Copilot Chat in Teams to synthesize your communications involving an actual thread you're involved in. At the same time, you plan to employ the prompting best practice of "iterate, iterate, iterate" by digging deeper into those items.

1. You should look through threads in both your Outlook Inbox and your Teams Chat to find a topic or project name that appears in both your emails and chats. You should identify the name of this topic/project so that you can enter it in the Copilot prompt in the next step.
1. In **Microsoft Teams**, select **Copilot** in the navigation pane. Doing so opens the **Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat** window within Teams.
1. In the **Copilot Chat** window, enter the following text in the prompt at the bottom of the page. Replace "topic/project of your choice" with the name that you chose from the first step, and then select the **Send** icon. **Summarize all my emails, meetings, and chats over the past 30 days related to {topic/project of your choice}**.
1. After Copilot responds with a summary of each communication, note the prompts that appear above the main prompt field at the bottom of the page. Copilot generated these prompts based on the summarized list of data that it returned. For example, you may see prompts such as:
   - "List any action items for me"
   - "Provide more details on the meeting with {person's name}"
   - "Summarize the key decisions from these communications"
   - "Draft an email to the team about the project participation"
1. Select one of these prompts to see how Copilot Chat in Teams responds. When you review the response, note how the Copilot-generated prompts change based on the prompt that you selected.
1. Note the iterative nature of this design. As you continue submitting Copilot-generated prompts, each response includes a new set of prompts associated with the data that Copilot returned. This design enables you to continue digging deeper into the communication history of the project or topic, while also requesting that Copilot perform specific tasks in follow-up. For example, emailing a person or team, identifying deadlines, and so on.
1. Review the list of topics that Copilot identified. While this list is a good start, you feel that Copilot can make the information even more valuable by ranking the topics based on their order of importance. As in the Relecloud scenario, you also plan to conduct a meeting on these issues, so knowing their order of importance can help dictate which topics you should discuss first in the meeting. Enter the following prompt and select the **Send** icon: **Please rank these topics by order of importance**.
1. Review Copilot's response. While it tries to rank the items, "order of importance" can be a subjective filter that can vary depending on the specific context and priorities of the project. Copilot may be able to make this distinction based on the nature of your action items. Or it may be unable to determine which items are most important if it has no background to base that judgement upon. If the latter occurs, you may need to follow the prompting best practice of:  **Iterate, iterate, iterate**. Instead of listing topics by order of importance, which Copilot might not be able to decipher given its limited understanding of the **{topic/project of your choice}**, instead focus on the topics that are related to a specific person, meeting, or other issue that are of importance to you. If you find yourself in this scenario, then consider entering the following prompt and replace {person/meeting/topic name of your choice} with the name of the person, meeting, or topic that you want to focus on first: **In all the topics that you previously identified, which ones involve {person/meeting/topic name of your choice}**? And even if Copilot ranked your topics following your prior request, you could still try this prompt to see how Copilot responds. 
1. As in the Relecloud scenario, you now want Copilot to create a list of potential topics for an upcoming meeting that you plan to schedule with all of the individuals associated with the **{topic/project of your choice}**. Enter the following prompt and select the **Send** icon: **I want to schedule a meeting with all the individuals associated with the {topic/project of your choice}. Can you please create an agenda for this proposed meeting based on the order of importance of the topics**.
1. Review the results. If Copilot didn't provide a list of suggested invitees for this meeting in its response, then enter the following prompt asking it to so: **For this proposed meeting, please provide a list of suggested invitees who are likely to have relevant insights based on their roles and recent topics involving {topic/project of your choice}**.
1. Review the agenda and suggested invitees that Copilot generated. If you wish, ask Copilot other questions, or direct it to complete any other task that may be of interest to you related to this project or topic.
1. You can close the Microsoft Edge browser tab once you’re finished with Copilot Chat.
