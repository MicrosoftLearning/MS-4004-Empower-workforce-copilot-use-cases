# Collaborate on a live troubleshooting guide using Copilot in Loop
---
Microsoft Loop is designed for dynamic, flexible collaboration, which makes it perfect for teams that need to co-create, adapt, and respond quickly. When Copilot is added to the mix, Loop becomes a powerful space where Customer Support professionals can build live documents, troubleshoot complex issues across departments, and keep everyone aligned in real time. It's especially useful for support teams working on evolving processes, shared guides, or live client issues that require constant updates and input from multiple stakeholders.

With Copilot in Loop, support professionals can quickly generate structured content like troubleshooting checklists, FAQ drafts, or internal playbooks, and then invite teammates from IT, Product, or Communications to contribute and refine in one shared space. Copilot helps analyze the problem, suggest workflows, assign responsibilities, and keep the content organized using live components that update wherever they're shared. It transforms how support teams handle recurring issues or create scalable resources for both internal and external use.

Using Copilot in Loop gives Customer Support teams the ability to not just react to issues, but to proactively document and improve how those issues are handled across the business. It enables true cross-functional collaboration and ensures that living documents, such as troubleshooting guides and escalation flows, are always current, actionable, and easy for everyone to contribute to.

## Exercise

As the Customer Service Manager at Fabrikam, you recently noticed a rise in login-related support requests coming from multiple clients using the company’s customer portal. These issues range from password errors to multifactor authentication failures and delayed account access each affecting customer satisfaction and putting added pressure on the support team. To address the situation quickly and consistently, you want to lead the development of a unified troubleshooting guide that other departments can also contribute to and rely on.

To make this guide collaborative, flexible, and always up to date, you plan to use Copilot in Microsoft Loop. With input needed from Support, IT, and the Communications team, Loop provides the ideal space to co-create a live document that outlines the login issue resolution process step-by-step. With the help of Copilot, you can structure the content, assign responsibilities by team, and build a checklist that everyone can contribute to in real time. Your goal is to ensure clients receive fast, accurate help, while your internal teams stay aligned and efficient.

1. If you have **Microsoft 365** open in a tab, then proceed to the next step. Otherwise, open a new tab in your **Microsoft Edge** browser, and then enter the following URL: [**https://www.office.com**](https://www.office.com)
1. In **Microsoft 365**, select **Loop** if it appears in the left-hand navigation pane. If it doesn't appear there, then select **Apps**, and on the **Apps** page, locate **Loop** and then select it.
1. In **Microsoft Loop**, select the **Get Started** button at the top of the page and then complete the sign-in process.
1. In **Loop**, you want to create a new workspace for this project, so select the plus sign (**Create new**) icon that appears at the top of the navigation pane. In the menu that appears, select **New workspace**.
1. In the **Create a new workspace** window, enter **Troubleshooting Guide** for your workspace name, and then select the **Create** button.
1. You're now in the first page for your new workspace. The name of the page is currently **Untitled**. Note the page (Untitled) also appears in the middle navigation pane. In the main body of the page, select in the **Untitled** field and change the name of the page to: **Customer Service Troubleshooting Guide** Note how the page name is automatically updated in the navigation pane.
1. In the **Just start typing...** field that appears below the heading, enter a forward slash **(/)**.
1. In the drop-down menu that appears, under the **Copilot** section at the top of the menu, select **Draft page content**. You plan to enter your own custom prompt, so proceed to the next step and don't select any of the suggested prompts from the menu.
1. In the Copilot prompt field that appears, enter the following prompt: **Create a Customer Service troubleshooting checklist for resolving client login issues on our portal**.
1. Review the list of items. You want the items broken down by step. If Copilot has already done so, then proceed to the next step. Otherwise, enter the following prompt: **Break down the troubleshooting process into clear steps**.
1. Review Copilot's response in the detail pane. Now that you entered a few prompts, note how Loop not only keeps a history of each prompt in the Copilot window, but when you click on the prompts, it shows what the document looked like after Copilot acted on the prompt. This design provides a running historical account of each change and how the document was affected.
1. While you feel like you’re off to a good start, you want to get a little more detailed in the tasks associated with each step. As such, enter the following prompt in the Copilot window: **This is a good start, but some of the tasks are too high-level. Please get more detailed on the tasks that you identified in each step**.
1. Review Copilot’s response. While it looks better, there’s one thing that you feel is still missing. Nowhere does it indicate who’s responsible for each step. To address this shortcoming, enter the following prompt in the Copilot window: **Please identify which team (Support, IT, or Client) is responsible for each step**.
1. After scanning the list one last time, you realize that it's missing key contact information and the company's escalation policy. To address these missing pieces, enter the following prompt in the Copilot window: **Add a section at the top with key contact information and the company's escalation policy**.
1. After consulting with other members of your team, you decide to make one more change. To make the document more useful for each team, you want Copilot to change it from a simple list into a Loop checklist component. Doing so enables users to mark each step once it's complete. To make this conversion, enter the following prompt: **Turn this list into a Loop checklist component so teams can update it in real time**.
1. In our testing, Copilot successfully turned this list into a checklist in which you can mark each item complete. However, in doing so, it always dropped the team that's responsible for each step. If that happened to you, then enter the following prompt to have Copilot add back this key piece of information: **That looks good. However, when you converted the list to a Loop checklist component, you accidentally dropped the teams (Support, IT, or Client) that are responsible for each step. Can you please add that information back into this Loop component checklist**.
1. At this point, you're satisfied with the checklist. However, to play it safe, you decide to ask Copilot in Loop to recommend any other changes. Enter the following prompt: **Are there any other things that you think should be added to this checklist to make it a more effective Customer Service troubleshooting guide**?
1. Review Copilot's response. In our testing, Copilot added a section on **Additional Recommendations** to the end of the document. What did it do for you?
1. Since you completed this exercise, you can close the Microsoft Edge browser tab.
