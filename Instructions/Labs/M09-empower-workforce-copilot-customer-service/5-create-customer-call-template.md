# Create a customer call summary template using Copilot in OneNote
---
Microsoft OneNote has long been a go-to tool for organizing information, taking notes, and tracking ongoing work. With the addition of Copilot, it becomes a powerful assistant that helps Customer Support professionals structure their thoughts, streamline documentation, and create templates that boost efficiency across the team. Instead of manually formatting notes after every call or meeting, support reps can use Copilot to generate clean, consistent summaries that are easy to review and share.

Copilot in OneNote can help create reusable templates for capturing client interactions, including fields for client information, issues discussed, actions taken, and follow-ups required. It can also suggest tags for categorizing different types of cases, making it easier to search and reference later. For support teams dealing with high volumes of customer calls or recurring issues, this feature turns OneNote into more than a note-taking tool it becomes a lightweight case tracking system tailored to your needs.

By using Copilot in OneNote, support professionals save time, reduce inconsistency, and ensure that key details are never missed. Whether you're logging call notes, creating onboarding checklists, or drafting internal documentation, Copilot helps you focus less on formatting and more on delivering excellent customer service.

## Exercise

As the Customer Service Manager at Adventure Works Cycles, you're looking to standardize how your team documents customer interactions during calls. Right now, customer support reps are taking notes in various formats, leading to inconsistencies in how client concerns, actions, and follow-ups are tracked. To ensure all critical information is captured efficiently and consistently, you decide to create a standardized call summary template that your team can use for every client interaction. This template should help improve internal communication, provide clarity on next steps, and ensure no critical details are overlooked.

To accomplish this goal, you plan to use Copilot in OneNote to generate a reusable template that captures all the essential elements of each client call, from the initial concern to the resolution and follow-up steps. Copilot can help in creating sections for client details, a summary of the issue, and space for internal notes that don't need to be shared with the client. By ensuring the template is easy to fill out in real time, you can create a tool that saves your team valuable time, helps improve data consistency, and supports quicker responses for future calls. You plan to save this template in a shared notebook, making it accessible to the entire customer support team for use across the board.

1. If you have **Microsoft 365** open in a tab, then proceed to the next step. Otherwise, open a new tab in your **Microsoft Edge** browser, and then enter the following URL: [**https://www.office.com**](https://www.office.com)
1. In **Microsoft 365**, select **OneNote** if it appears in the left-hand navigation pane. If it doesn't appear there, then select **Apps**, and on the **Apps** page, locate **OneNote** and then select it.
1. In **Microsoft OneNote**, under the Create new section, select **Blank notebook**.
1. In the New notebook window that appears, enter **Support team shared notebook** in the **Notebook name** field, and then select the **Create** button. 
1. In the notebook, you should begin by adding a new section. In the Section column, select **+Add section**. In the **Section Name** window that appears, enter **Call Templates**. This name keeps all reusable templates for call documentation in one place, making them easy to find and expand later (for example, different templates for support, sales, or onboarding calls).
1. Within your new **Call Templates** section, you should add a new page. You don't need to select **+Add page**, since an **Untitled Page** was already created for you by default. If you did select **+Add page** by accident, you now have two untitled pages. In this case, right-click on one of the untitled pages and select **Delete Page** from the drop-down menu. At the top of the page, OneNote displays a line followed by the current date and time. Select into the space that appears above the line. This field is the heading for the page. In this heading field, enter **Customer Service Call Summary Template**. 

    > [!TIP]
    > If you try to copy and paste this name in the heading field, OneNote pastes it into the body of the page, which you don't want. You must manually type this name in the heading field.

1. On the ribbon at the top of the page, select **Copilot**. 
1. In the **Copilot** pane that appears, enter the following prompt: **Create a call summary template for customer service reps to log client concerns, actions taken, and follow-up steps**.
1. Note how Copilot displays its generated response in the Copilot detail pane rather than in the OneNote page. This process is similar to how Copilot works in Word. You must copy and paste the template into the OneNote page. Select the **Copy** icon that appears at that bottom of Copilot's generated response. Then select into the page below the date and time and select **Ctrl+V** to paste in Copilot's response. 
1. Note how the **Copy** icon in the Copilot pane copied not only the template, but also the conversational text that Copilot generated - such as, "Sure I can help with that!" Highlight any of the conversational text that appears above and below the **Customer Service Call Summary Template** and delete it. 
1. You noticed that your original prompt was missing some key data. To address this shortcoming, enter the following prompt in the Copilot pane: **Please include fields for: Client Name, Date, Contact Method, Summary of Issue, Resolution, Follow-Up Needed**.
1. Review the generated response, which you feel is much more complete. Select the **Copy** icon that appears below the response. On the OneNote page, highlight the original template information that you previously pasted in then select the **Delete** button to delete it. Rather than deleting the highlighted text, you could have selected **Ctrl+V**, which would have replaced the original version with Copilot's latest version that you just copied. However, each time we attempted to this step in our testing, the lasted version was pasted in the page in a bulleted list fashion, with each line preceded by a bullet. We found that by deleting the original version and then pasting the copied new version, it was pasted in properly. As you did before, highlight and delete any of the extraneous conversational text that was copied from Copilot's response.
1. While you're happy with how the template is looking thus far, there's one final change that you want to make. You  want Copilot to recommend dropdowns or tags for categorization. This feature should help your customer service reps quickly identify and log the nature of the client's concerns. To do so, enter the following prompt in the Copilot pane: **Suggest dropdowns or tags that we can use to categorize issues (for example, billing, technical, feature request)**.
1. Note how Copilot generated a new version of the template that included a section of issue categories. While you could delete the current version of the template from the page and paste in the entire new version just like you did before, this time you decide just to copy and paste in the category section. In the Copilot pane, highlight the categories section, select **Ctrl+C** to copy the highlighted text, then place your cursor in the current template on the OneNote page at the location you desire (such as in front of the **Summary of Issue** field) and then select **Ctrl+V** to paste in the category text. 
1. You're satisfied with the current template, but you want to ask Copilot how you can improve the layout. To do so, enter the following prompt: **How can I improve the layout to make it visually easy to scan and enable support reps to quickly fill it out during live calls with a customer**?
1. Copilot may respond with formatting improvements, such as tables, headers, bullet points, or color-coded sections. You can accept, reject, or modify the suggestions if you wish.
1. Once you finish updating the template with any other changes, you can close the Microsoft Edge browser tab.
