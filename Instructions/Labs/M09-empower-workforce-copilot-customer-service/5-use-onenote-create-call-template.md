As the Customer Service Manager at Lamna Healthcare Company, you're looking to standardize how your team documents customer interactions during calls. Right now, customer support reps are taking notes in various formats, leading to inconsistencies in how client concerns, actions, and follow-ups are tracked. To ensure all critical information is captured efficiently and consistently, you decide to create a standardized call summary template that your team can use for every client interaction. This template should help improve internal communication, provide clarity on next steps, and ensure no critical details are overlooked.

To accomplish this goal, you plan to use Copilot in OneNote to generate a reusable template that captures all the essential elements of each client call, from the initial concern to the resolution and follow-up steps. Copilot can help in creating sections for client details, a summary of the issue, and space for internal notes that don't need to be shared with the client. By ensuring the template is easy to fill out in real time, you can create a tool that saves your team valuable time, helps improve data consistency, and supports quicker responses for future calls. You plan to save this template in a shared notebook, making it accessible to the entire customer support team for use across the board.

1.  In your Microsoft Edge browser, go to the **Microsoft 365** home page, select **Apps** in the navigation pane, and then on the **Apps** page, select **OneNote**.

2.  In **OneNote for the web**, create a blank notebook titled **Support team shared notebook.**

3.  In the new notebook, you should begin by adding a section titled **Call Templates**. This section can be used to keep all reusable templates for call documentation in one place, making them easy to find and expand later (for example, different templates for support, sales, or onboarding calls).

4.  Within the **Call Templates** section, you should add a new page. You don’t need to select **+Add page**, since an **Untitled Page** was already created for you by default when you added the **Call Templates** section. If you did select **+Add page** by accident, you now have two untitled pages. In this case, right-click on one of the untitled pages and select **Delete Page** from the drop-down menu. At the top of the page, OneNote displays a line followed by the current date and time. Select into the space that appears above the line. This field is the heading for the page. In this heading field, enter **Customer Service Call Summary Template.**

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you try to copy and paste this name into the heading field, OneNote pastes it into the body of the page, which you don’t want. You must manually type this name in the heading field.

5.  On the ribbon at the top of the page, select **Copilot**.

6.  In the **Copilot** pane, ask Copilot to create a call summary template for customer service reps to log client concerns, actions taken, and follow-up steps.

7.  Note how Copilot displays its generated response in the Copilot detail pane rather than in the OneNote page. You must copy and paste the template into the OneNote page. Select the **Copy response** icon that appears at that bottom of Copilot’s generated response. Then select into the OneNote page below the date and time and select **Ctrl+V** to paste in Copilot’s response. Delete any extraneous conversational text that was copied in at the start and end of the content.

8.  Review the contents of the template that Copilot created. While you’re happy with how the template is looking thus far, you want support reps to be able to assign a severity level to the issue. Ask Copilot to add severity tags in the template.

9.  Copy the revised template and paste it into the OneNote page, replacing the existing template.

10.  Upon reviewing the template, you noticed that your original prompt was missing some key data. To address this shortcoming, ask Copilot to update the template to include fields for: Client Name, Date, Contact Method, Summary of Issue, Resolution, Follow-Up Needed.

11.  Review the generated response. During our testing, Copilot didn’t return the entire template that included the newly requested fields. Instead, it just displayed a section with this new information. If your response was similar, copy and paste this new section at the end of the template in the Notebook page. However, if Copilot returned the entire template along with this new section, then delete the existing template on the OneNote page and then copy and paste in the revised template.

12.  You’re satisfied with the current template, but you want to ask Copilot how you can improve the layout. Ask Copilot how it can improve the layout to make it visually easy to scan and enable support reps to quickly fill it out during live calls with a customer?

13.  Copilot might respond with formatting improvements, such as tables, headers, bullet points, or color-coded sections. You can accept, reject, or modify the suggestions if you wish.

14. Once you finish updating the template with any other changes, you can close the browser tab.
