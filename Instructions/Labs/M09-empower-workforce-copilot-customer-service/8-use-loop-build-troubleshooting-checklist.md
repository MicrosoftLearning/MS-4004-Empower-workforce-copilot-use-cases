As the Customer Service Manager at Tailwind Traders, you recently noticed a rise in product warranty validation issues coming from multiple clients using the company’s customer portal. These issues range from serial‑number mismatches to missing proof‑of‑purchase scans—each affecting customer satisfaction and putting added pressure on the support team. To address the situation quickly and consistently, you want to lead the development of a unified troubleshooting guide that other departments can also contribute to and rely upon.

To make this guide collaborative, flexible, and always up to date, you plan to use Copilot in Microsoft Loop. With input needed from Support, Warranty Operations, and Product Engineering_,_ Loop provides the ideal space to co-create a live document that outlines product warranty validation step-by-step. With the help of Copilot, you can structure the content, assign responsibilities by team, and build a checklist that everyone can contribute to in real time. Your goal is to ensure clients receive fast, accurate help, while your internal teams stay aligned and efficient.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  In your Microsoft Edge browser, go to the **Microsoft 365** home page **(https://www.office.com)**, select **Apps** in the navigation pane, and then select **Loop** from the **Apps** menu.

2.  In **Loop for the web**, create a new workspace titled **Troubleshooting Guide**.

3.  You're now in the first page for your new workspace. To begin, change the current title of the first page from **Untitled** to **Product Warranty Troubleshooting Guide.** Note how the page name is automatically updated in the navigation pane.

4.  Open the **Copilot** pane for this page.

5.  In the **Copilot** prompt, ask Copilot to create a Product Warranty Validation troubleshooting checklist for resolving product warranty validation issues.

6.  Review the list of items that Copilot generated. You want the items broken down by step.
    - If Copilot broke down the items by step, then select the **Copy** icon that appears at the end of Copilot’s response, then select into the Loop page and paste in the content **(Ctrl+V)**. Delete any extraneous content from the conversation that was copy and pasted along with the content (typically at the beginning and end of the content).
    - If Copilot didn’t break the troubleshooting process into clear steps, then ask it to do so. Copy its response, paste it into the Loop page, and delete any extraneous text that appears at the start and end of the content.

7.  Review Copilot’s response in the Copilot pane. While you feel like you’re off to a good start, you want to get a little more detailed in the tasks associated with each step. As such, tell Copilot that what it produced is a good start, but some of the tasks are too high-level. Ask it to get more detailed on the tasks that it identified in each step.

8.  Review Copilot’s response. While it looks better, there’s one thing that you feel is still missing. Nowhere does it indicate who’s responsible for each step. To address this shortcoming, ask Copilot to identify which team (such as Support, Warranty Operations, and Product Engineering) is responsible for each step.

9.  Copy its response and then paste it into the Loop page, replacing the original checklist content. Delete any extraneous text that appears at the start and end of the content.

10. After scanning the list one last time in the Loop page, you realize that it’s missing key contact information and the company’s escalation policy. To address these missing pieces, ask Copilot to add a section at the top with key contact information and the company’s escalation policy.

11. In previous prompts, Copilot always returned the entire list along with the updated content. However, for this prompt, Copilot simply displayed the section containing the contact information. Copy this content and then paste it into the Loop page at the top of the page. It should be the first section of content on the page. Delete any extraneous text that appears at the start and end of the content.

12. After consulting with other members of your team, you decide to make one more change. To make the document more useful for each team, you want Copilot to change it from a simple list into a Loop checklist component. Doing so enables users to mark each step once it’s complete. To make this conversion, ask Copilot to turn this list into a Loop checklist component so teams can update it in real time.

13. Copy its response and then paste it into the Loop page, replacing the current checklist content. Delete any extraneous text that appears at the start and end of the content.

14. At this point, you’re satisfied with the checklist. However, to play it safe, ask Copilot if there are any other things that should be added to this checklist to make it a more effective Product Warranty troubleshooting guide.

15. Review Copilot’s response. Since it looks good, copy this content and then paste it into the Loop page at the end of the page. It should be the last section of content on the page. Delete any extraneous text that appears at the start and end of the content.
