Tailwind Traders has been receiving an increasing number of product-quality inquiries from its B2B dealer network. Some dealers provide rich detail—photos, videos, purchase documentation—while others submit vague or incomplete information, leading to extended troubleshooting cycles and inconsistent communication. Recently, several dealers expressed frustration over response quality. Some replies were too technical, others lacked clear next steps, and many didn’t follow a consistent tone or structure.

As Tailwind’s Customer Service Manager, you're tasked with improving the overall professionalism and clarity of outbound communications. To improve consistency, your leadership team wants you to establish a standardized written-response template that all support agents must use when replying to dealers. This template must:

- Reflect Tailwind’s confident and trusted brand voice
- Capture all the information needed to properly evaluate a product-quality concern
- Clearly outline the actions Tailwind took, and next steps the dealer must follow
- Work well as a repeatable, clean format for email, Word attachments, or internal documentation

Since Copilot in Word specializes in generating and transforming content, you plan to use it to create a reusable communication template. Because you want to create a polished document, you then plan to use Copilot’s Writing Coach agent, which specializes in coaching and improving your writing. You want to use Writing Coach to strengthen tone, improve clarity, refine grammar and structure, and ensure the template is dealer‑appropriate and ready for real‑world use. You can then share this new resource across support, operations, and product teams, ultimately improving the quality and speed of Tailwind’s customer resolutions.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  In your Microsoft Edge browser, go to the **Microsoft 365** home page, select **Apps** in the navigation pane, and then select **Word** from the **Apps** menu.

2.  In **Word** **for the web**, create a blank document.

3.  In the **Describe what you’d like to draft with Copilot** field at the top of the page, ask Copilot to create a customer support template. Submit the following prompt:

    > [!NOTE]
    > For this first prompt, we’ve provided the text so you can see what an effective prompt looks like when it incorporates the four key elements discussed in the Introduction unit. You must write all remaining prompts in this exercise, but in doing so, you can use this prompt as a model to emulate._
    
    **I’m the Customer Service Manager for Tailwind Traders. In order for Tailwind to raise the overall professionalism, clarity, and consistency of its outbound communications, please create a standardized written-response template that all Customer Support agents can use when replying to dealers. This template must:**
    
    - **Reflect Tailwind’s confident and trusted brand voice.**
    - **Capture all the information needed to properly evaluate a product-quality concern.**
    - **Clearly outline the actions Tailwind took, as well as next steps the dealer must follow.**
    - **Work well as a repeatable, clean format for email, Word attachments, or internal documentation.**
        
    **The template should include the following sections: Issue Summary, Product Details, Troubleshooting Actions Taken, Required Dealer Follow‑Up, Expected Timeline.**

4.  Review the first draft of the template. While it looks OK, you feel it should include a few more sections that can capture everything a rep or dealer needs to move a case forward.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In this task, you use Copilot in Word to make several updates to the template. Doing so enables you to see how Copilot works in draft mode, where each request produces a new draft. You can then use the forward and backward arrows to review various drafts and request changes for a specific draft. For example, you could navigate to draft 3 of 5 and request a change to it, which would result in draft 6 of 6. When you’re satisfied with a draft that you want to turn into your actual Word document, you must select the **Keep It** button. Don’t select this button until you finish your updates. If you do select the **Keep It** button and then decide to make more changes, you must do so using the Copilot pane, which doesn’t make changes directly to the document.

    Ask Copilot to add the following sections to the template, each with clear field labels:

    - **Dealer and case metadata**. Dealer Name, Dealer ID, Case ID, Priority, Severity, Date Opened, Date of Reply

    - **Intake details**. Original Dealer Request summary, Attachments provided (Photo/Video/Proof of Purchase), Channel, Contact Person

    - **Reproduction steps**. Environment, Product version/firmware, Steps tried, Reproduction result (Yes/No)

    - **Risk and impact assessment**. Safety impact, Customer impact, Business priority

    - **Resolution status**. Current status, Root cause (if known), Temporary workaround, Final fix ETA

    - **Escalation path**. When to escalate, Who to escalate to, Service Level Agreement (SLA) for response

    - **Communication log**. Date, who contacted, summary of each interaction

    - **Next checkpoint**. Commit dates, responsible owner

5.  Review the second draft of the template. You feel that it looks better since it captures all the relevant information needed for a case. However, from a structural standpoint, you would like to insert a structured table and checklists for consistency purposes. Doing so would make the template operationally fillable by support reps during live work. 
    <br/><br/>You first plan to add the table, so ensure you’re on the final draft and then ask Copilot to insert a two-column table in the “Product Details” section that contains these rows: Product line, Model/SKU, Serial Number, Production batch/Lot, Purchase date, and Warranty status.

6.  Review the updated draft to ensure the table is correct. If there’s any issues with it, ask Copilot to make the necessary corrections. 

7. When everything looks good, ensure you’re on the final draft. Ask Copilot to add a checklist in the “Required Dealer Follow Up” section that provides checkboxes for each of the following items: Provide serial number photo, Provide proof of purchase, Run diagnostic steps (attach logs), Confirm shipping address (if replacement), and Acknowledge Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) terms.

8.  Review the updated draft to ensure the checklist appears the way you want. In our testing, Copilot included these items in a bulleted list, but it didn’t display a checkbox in front of each item. If that happened to you, ask Copilot to fix this list in the “Required Dealer Follow Up” section by changing it from a bulleted list to a list with a blank checkbox in front of each item.

9.  Review the updated results. In our testing, Copilot returned the “Required Dealer Follow Up” section rather than the entire template. It also didn’t display checkboxes for each item; rather, it kept the bulleted list. 
    <br/><br/>If the same thing happened to you, select the backward arrow to go back to the prior draft, which contains the entire template with the bulleted list of required dealer follow-up items. While it displays the items in a bulleted list rather than with checkboxes, you decide that you can live with that format for now.

10.  You should now be on the final draft version that you’re satisfied with. Ensure you’re on the final draft that you want, because once you select the **Keep It** button, Copilot discards all the other drafts and you can’t return to draft mode. Select the **Keep it** button, which turns the draft you want into a Word document. Select the file name field that appears above the menu bar and change the file name to **Dealer Support Template**.  
    <br/>In the remaining steps, you plan to use Copilot’s Writing Coach agent to polish the template’s tone, clarity, grammar, and so on.

11.  Open **Microsoft 365** and in the navigation pane, under the **Agents** section, select **All agents**. In the **Agent Store**, under the **Your agents** section, select **See more**. In the expanded list of **Your agents**, select **Writing Coach**.

12.  In the **Writing Coach** agent, attach the **Dealer Support Template** file from your OneDrive, which you created earlier in this task. Ask the Writing Coach agent to rewrite the attached file with a more concise, confident tone suitable for B2B communication.

13.  Review the results. Note the text the agent displayed at the end of its response, which describes what it did and why the changes are better for B2B communication.

14.  While the update looks good, you’re concerned that with so much data, a dealer might have trouble following the logical sequence of information. Ask the Writing Coach agent to improve the logical flow of the template so that dealers can easily follow the issue summary, actions taken, and required next steps.

15. Review the document. Note the text the agent displayed at the end of its response, which indicates why the revised flow improves communication.

16. Finally, ask the agent what other changes it would suggest to improve this template.

17. Review the changes the agent suggested. Feel free to ask the agent to create a redesigned version that includes one or two of these suggested improvements.

18. Once you’re done, in a real-world scenario, you would select the **Copy Response** icon that appears below the final version of the document that you want to use. You would then paste the content into a Word document for use by your organization. Feel free to do that now if you wish to keep a copy of the final template that you created.
