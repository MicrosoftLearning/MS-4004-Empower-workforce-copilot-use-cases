# Exercise 2, Task 3: Use Copilot in PowerPoint to create a legal presentation
---
Lamna Healthcare Company is preparing to present audit‑related findings to both executive leadership and its Board of Directors. The internal audit report highlighted multiple areas where department practices were inconsistent or insufficient, including device‑handling oversight, remote clinical access protocols, and documentation gaps tied to regulatory standards. As the company’s General Counsel, you tracked these findings in Loop (in Task 1) and compiled them into a document titled **Lamna Executive Briefing Source.docx** in your OneDrive folder.

You now want to create a **clean, executive‑ready slide deck** that distills these findings into a high‑level, visually compelling story. Using PowerPoint with Copilot, you plan to generate a briefing deck that summarizes the issues, illustrates departmental responsibilities, and presents a 90‑day corrective action roadmap. You want this deck to serve as the foundation for Lamna’s compliance reform initiative and board‑level reporting.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  In your Microsoft Edge browser, go to the **Microsoft 365** home page, select **Apps** in the navigation pane, and then select **PowerPoint** from the **Apps** menu.

2.  In **PowerPoint for the web**, create a blank presentation.

3.  In the Copilot menu that appears on the title slide for the blank presentation, select the **Create a new presentation with file** option.

4.  In the **Create a presentation with Copilot** window that appears, select the **Reference files** option and select the **Lamna Executive Briefing Source.docx** file from your OneDrive.

5.  In the **Create a presentation with Copilot** window, enter in the prompt field a description of what you want Copilot to create. Remember to address the four key areas of an effective prompt. Ask Copilot to create a presentation targeted to Lamna Healthcare Company’s executive leadership team. The presentation should include five slides that summarize the key findings from the attached **Lamna Executive Briefing Source.docx** file. The presentation should summarize the company’s recent internal audit findings that are included in the attached file, including policy misalignment, device‑handling gaps, and compliance risks. Tell Copilot to use visuals and bullet points for clarity.

6.  Review the outline that Copilot generated. If you’re not satisfied with the outline, revise your prompt at the top of the form and resubmit it. Once you’re satisfied with the outline, select both the **Presentation style** and the **Image preferences** that you want to use, and then select the **Generate slides** button.

7.  It can sometimes take 3-5 minutes for Copilot to generate the slides. Once the slides are created, PowerPoint displays them in **Slide Sorter** mode. You want to see the slides in normal mode, so select **View** on the PowerPoint menu bar, and then select **Normal**.

8.  At this point, you have a solid foundation for your executive leadership presentation. However, you want to take advantage of Copilot and have it enhance the presentation by adding another slide. There are two ways to use Copilot in PowerPoint:

    - If you select the **Copilot** button on the far-right end of the **Home** ribbon, the **Copilot Chat** pane opens. The Copilot Chat pane starts a chat with Copilot, but it generally can’t push changes directly into the slide deck. Instead, you must copy/paste from its responses.

    - The **Copilot** icon that appears above the first slide can directly change the open deck. For example, you can use this Copilot to add a slide or topic (a section with multiple slides) to the presentation. This option is the one you plan to use in this task.  

    You want to add a **Key Risks and Impact Assessment** slide that appears before the **90-day Corrective Action Roadmap** slide. Select this location in the list of slides (a red line should appear before the 90-day Corrective Action Roadmap slide). Then select the **Copilot** icon that appears above the current slide. In the menu that appears, select **Add a slide**.

9.  In the **Add a slide with Copilot** window that appears, ask Copilot to add a slide titled **Key Risks and Impact Assessment**. Since executives want to understand what’s at stake, this slide should highlight the top 3–5 risks identified across the updated policy sections, their potential operational or regulatory impact, their severity (for example, low/medium/high), and the areas that require the most urgent attention. Since Copilot requires a topic for a new slide, tell it that the topic for the slide is Risk Mitigation. Ask it to include a visual emphasis, such as callouts or highlights, for critical points.

10.  Once Copilot generates the slide, you feel that it looks OK, so select the **Keep it** button. Did Copilot place the slide at the location you selected? If it didn’t, then drag and drop the slide to the proper location.

11.  You now want Copilot to generate speaker notes for each slide. For starters, check several of the slides to see if any speaker notes were currently applied at the time Copilot created the slides. During testing, some slides had speaker notes and others didn’t. Since you want Copilot to generate speaker notes for every slide, open the Copilot pane (you might need to select the **Home** tab to access the **Copilot** icon) and then ask Copilot to create concise speaker notes for each slide.

12.  Review the speaker notes that Copilot generated. Here’s the important thing you must be aware of regarding speaker notes–at present, Copilot can't directly edit or insert speaker notes into your PowerPoint file. Its capabilities are limited to generating and formatting content for you to copy and paste into your slides. That being said, you have two options:

        - **Option 1**. For each slide, you can manually copy the speaker note Copilot generated for it and paste the note into the Notes section for the slide.
    
        - **Option 2**. You can have Copilot generate a downloadable file (Word or text) that contains all the notes labeled by slide. If you choose this option, you can then reference the notes from the file during your presentation.

13.  Because you don’t have time to copy and paste in the speaker notes for each slide, and since you like the idea of having printed notes in front of you during the presentation, ask Copilot to generate a downloadable Word document containing the notes for each slide.

14.  Download the speaker note file once Copilot generates the link for it. Open the file and verify that it includes all the speaker notes.
