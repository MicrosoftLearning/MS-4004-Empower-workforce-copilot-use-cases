# Exercise 2, Task 4: Use Copilot in OneNote to create a compliance notebook
---
Lamna Healthcare Company’s compliance issues stem partly from teams using different versions of policies, outdated reference materials, or relying on tribal knowledge. The Legal and Compliance departments need a single, consistently updated knowledge hub where employees across IT, Legal, Clinical Operations, and QA can access the latest rules, role requirements, checklists, and training expectations.

You’re tasked with creating a Lamna Compliance Hub in OneNote. To do so, you plan to use Copilot to draft the foundational content. Lamna plans to use this notebook as the operational playbook for its compliance overhaul, ensuring every team remains aligned with  accurate, easily accessible guidance as reform efforts roll out.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  In your Microsoft Edge browser, go to the **Microsoft 365** home page, select **Apps** in the navigation pane, and then on the **Apps** page, select **OneNote**.

2.  In **OneNote for the web**, create a blank notebook titled **Lamna Compliance Hub**.

3.  In the new notebook, add the following sections:

    - Regulatory Requirements

    - Device Handling Rules

    - Training and Certification

4.  Select **Copilot** in the menu bar to open the Copilot pane. If announcements appear, select the **Skip** button at the bottom of the Copilot pane to close them.

5.  Select the **Regulatory Requirements** section. Change the title of the page to **FDA and State Requirements**. Then ask Copilot to summarize the primary FDA and state‑level compliance requirements relevant to Lamna HealthCare Company’s medical devices in plain, actionable language.

6.  Review Copilot’s response. You feel it's a good starting point, so select the **Copy** icon at the end of the response, then paste the content in the notebook. Delete any extraneous conversational text that was copied in at the start and end of the content.

7.  While it looks good, you think it could be improved by including an FDA + state compliance matrix. Ask Copilot to generate this matrix, then copy and paste the generated content at the end of the **FDA and State Requirements** page. Delete any extraneous conversational text that was copied in at the start and end of the content.

8.  Select the **Device Handling Rules** section. Change the title of the page to **Chain of Custody Checklist**. Then ask Copilot to draft a checklist for maintaining chain‑of‑custody for remote clinical devices.

9.  Review the content. While it looks fine, you would prefer an actual checklist. Ask Copilot to convert this content into a fillable checklist. Copy and paste the generated checklist into the **Chain of Custody Checklist** page. Delete any extraneous conversational text that was copied in at the start and end of the content.

10. Select the **Training and Certification** section. Change the title of the page to **Roles and Certifications**. Then ask Copilot to create a table listing required roles and mandatory compliance certifications.

11. You feel it's a good starting point, so copy the content and paste it in the **Roles and Certifications** page. Delete any extraneous conversational text that was copied in at the start and end of the content.

12. You feel that Lamna employees could be best served with a roadmap of steps to achieve compliance. Ask Copilot to generate a compliance roadmap and to outline the steps needed to implement these compliance measures.

13. Review the content. While the data looks good, you feel that it might be bit overwhelming for company employees in its present form. Ask Copilot if it can turn this content into a OneNote-formatted Compliance Program page that uses OneNote‑friendly headings, indentation, bullets, and checkboxes.

14. Review the content. This revised content version looks clean and user-friendly, so copy the content and paste it at the end of the **Roles and Certifications** page. Delete any extraneous conversational text that was copied in at the start and end of the content.


15. After reviewing the completed OneNote notebook, you can see that it now provides a strong, well‑structured foundation for Lamna’s legal and compliance knowledge hub. This framework gives both departments a centralized starting point they can continue to expand and refine as new policies, guidance, and best practices emerge.
