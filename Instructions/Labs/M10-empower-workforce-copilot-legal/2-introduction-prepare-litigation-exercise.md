Modern legal departments are under increasing pressure to respond quickly and accurately to regulatory inquiries, contract risks, litigation exposure, and compliance demands. Microsoft 365 Copilot gives companies a powerful advantage by transforming how legal teams analyze information, prepare documentation, and coordinate responses. Instead of manually reviewing dense regulations or lengthy contracts, Copilot helps lawyers and compliance professionals rapidly interpret requirements, identify red flags, and generate internal guidance tailored to the organization’s needs.

In high‑stakes situations, such as responding to regulatory audits or preparing for potential litigation, speed and clarity matter. Copilot accelerates workflows by summarizing complex documents, drafting guidance in plain language, generating issue briefs for leadership, and helping teams visualize obligations and timelines. Tools like Copilot Chat, Copilot in Word, and the Researcher agent empower legal teams to quickly turn scattered information into actionable insights.

Beyond analysis and drafting, Copilot also supports operational readiness. Through integrated apps like SharePoint and Copilot Studio, organizations can build automated trackers, standardized templates, and no‑code agents that log inquiries, organize documentation, and support cross‑functional coordination. These capabilities help companies demonstrate diligence, maintain audit trails, and respond to regulators with confidence.

This exercise shows how Microsoft 365 Copilot enables companies to transform their regulatory response workflows—moving from reactive, manual processes to fast, structured, AI‑supported legal readiness.

### Scenario

In this exercise, you take on the role of an Associate Counsel for Boulder Innovations. Boulder is a mid‑sized manufacturer specializing in consumer electronics, smart home accessories, and a growing line of technology‑enhanced play products. Their portfolio includes interactive educational toys, remote controlled toys, connected devices, and modular electronic components used across multiple product families.

Boulder Innovations is preparing for a California state regulatory audit related to the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and its enhancement, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA). These laws represent some of the most comprehensive data privacy regulations in the United States. They’re designed to give California residents greater control over their personal information. State regulators are requesting evidence that Boulder assessed privacy risks, examined vendor exposure, and prepared appropriate legal guidance.

Although Boulder Innovations has operated in California for several years, this year is the first time in which it met all the thresholds required for compliance. Specifically, the CCPA and CPRA apply to businesses that:

- Operate in California.

- Have annual gross revenues exceeding $25 million.

- Buy, sell, or share the personal information of 100,000 or more California residents, households, or devices.

Due to recent business growth—including an expansion in the collection and handling of personal data, along with projected revenue increases—Boulder Innovations anticipates that it should meet the applicability thresholds in the upcoming fiscal year. As a result, the company is proactively preparing to ensure full compliance.

Your job is to lead the first wave of regulatory readiness tasks using Microsoft 365 Copilot. Boulder’s General Counsel wants you to:

- Analyze compliance obligations

- Review a large supplier contract that might be a source of exposure

- Prepare internal regulatory guidance

- Help functional teams visualize and prepare for investigative inquiries
