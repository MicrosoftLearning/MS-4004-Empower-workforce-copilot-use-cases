# Review and summarize a contract using Microsoft 365 Copilot in Word
---
Microsoft Word is a foundational tool for legal professionals, whether you're drafting contracts, reviewing agreements, or preparing internal memos. With Copilot in Word, legal teams gain a highly capable assistant that can accelerate document analysis, streamline drafting, and support the creation of clear, compliant content. Instead of starting from a blank page or manually scanning through dense legal language, Copilot helps you focus your time and expertise where it matters most, such as the legal judgment and strategy behind the document.

Copilot in Word can summarize long contracts into digestible bullet points, highlight unusual or risky clauses, and even suggest revised wording to improve clarity or reduce legal exposure. It can also help you create internal summaries or client-facing explanations of legal terms and obligations, tailored to a non-legal audience. Whether you're working on a vendor agreement, an employment policy, or a legal brief, Copilot can act as your first draft partner by speeding up the process without sacrificing precision.

By using Copilot in Word, legal professionals can enhance the efficiency and consistency of their work, reduce administrative load, and spend more time on high-value analysis. It isn't about replacing legal review. It's about clearing the path for more strategic thinking, faster collaboration, and better communication across legal and business teams.

In this exercise, you direct Copilot in Word to review a new vendor agreement for partnership with a new supplier. This contract is stored in a Word document. When you link a file such as this into a Copilot prompt, the file must be located in a OneDrive folder. You can't link to a locally stored file on your PC.

You can link the file into a Copilot prompt using one of the following methods:

1. Select the file from the Most Recently Used (MRU) file list.
1. Open the file and copy its path using the **Share** option, then paste the path into the prompt following the forward slash (/).
1. Copy the file's path from File Explorer and paste it into the prompt following the forward slash (/).

In this exercise, you select the vendor agreement from the MRU file list.

## Exercise

As the Lead Lawyer for Domestic Operations at Tailspin Toys, you’re tasked with reviewing a new supplier agreement for a potential partnership with VanArdsdel, Ltd. The plan is for VanArsdel to supply materials for the company’s new toy line of remote-controlled cars. The contract is lengthy, and while you need to ensure all the key terms align with Tailspin Toys' business objectives, there’s a tight deadline to summarize the document for senior management. You must distill the most important details of the agreement—such as terms related to payment, termination, liability, and governing law—into a clear, concise summary that can be quickly reviewed by internal stakeholders.

To streamline this process, you plan to use Copilot in Microsoft Word to automatically generate a summary of the contract, flag any potential red flags or unusual clauses, and provide suggestions for improving unclear sections. Copilot can help you focus on critical areas like indemnity clauses and termination terms, allowing you to identify any risks or areas for clarification. By utilizing Copilot’s suggestions and formatting tools, you can create a clear summary that you can easily share with other departments and leadership, ensuring Tailspin Toys makes informed decisions before moving forward with the vendor.

To reference the contract in Copilot, this exercise locates the file from the MRU file list.

Perform the following steps to review the VanArsdel supplier agreement using Copilot in Word:

1. Select the following link to open a copy of [VanArsdel Supplier Agreement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2320506). Select the **Download** button at the top of the screen to download the file to your computer.
1. Once the download is complete, open **File Explorer** and move the file from your **Downloads** folder to your **OneDrive - Microsoft** folder.
1. In this exercise, you access the document from the MRU file list. To get the file to appear in the list, open the document and then close it.
1. In **Microsoft 365**, select **Word** if it appears in the navigation pane. If it doesn't appear there, then select **Apps** in the navigation pane, and on the **Apps** page, select **Word**.
1. In the **Word** home page, select the **Create blank document** button.
1. In the **Copilot** prompt field that appears at the top of the blank document, enter the following prompt (don't select the **Generate** icon until later): **Summarize the attached contract in 5 bullet points: include term, termination, payment terms, liability, and governing law. Create a clear, concise summary that can be quickly reviewed by internal stakeholders**.
1. In the **prompt** field, select the **+Add content** button. In the drop-down menu that appears, the **All** tab is displayed by default. If the **VanArsdel Supplier Agreement** file appears, then select it. Otherwise, select the **Files** tab and then select the **VanArsdel Supplier Agreement** if it appears. If the file doesn't appear in either tab, then following the prompt, enter /van. Doing so opens the content menu, and the **VanArsdel Supplier Agreement** should appear in the **All** tab. Select the file. Note how the file is displayed in the prompt.
1. Select the **Generate** (forward arrow) icon. 
1. After reviewing the summary that Copilot created, you decide that it's a good starting point, although there are a few areas that you want to modify. Note how this version is draft **1 of 1**. Each iteration of this document is saved in a separate draft, which allows you to move back and forth between drafts. For example, viewing a previous draft can help you determine other changes that you want, or see how Copilot affected changes that you requested, or locate a draft that you want to keep as the final version. 
1. While you're satisfied with this initial summary, you want Copilot to check for red flags that were found in earlier contracts with other suppliers. You don't want to repeat those mistakes here. Keep in mind that when you ask Copilot to update or review a specific section, it only returns that section. So always make sure that you ask it to display the entire document along with the updated sections. To do so, enter the following prompt: **Highlight any unusual clauses or red flags in the Indemnity and Termination sections. When you do so, please return the entire document and not just the updated Indemnity and Termination sections**.
1. Review the red flags (if any) that Copilot generated. Note how this revised version of the Summary is now draft **2 of 2**. By selecting the back arrow (<), you can go back to the original version (1 of 2). Then selecting the forward arrow takes you back to the version following it (in this case, 2 of 2). As you continue, ensure that you’re on the draft version that applies to your latest request.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > When you prompt Copilot, always ensure that you're on the draft that applies to your prompt. Why? Because Copilot applies your request to the draft that's currently displayed rather than the last draft. For example, consider the scenario where you're working on a document, and you currently have six drafts. Let's assume you navigated back to draft 4 of 6 to check on the results of a previous change request. If you then enter a prompt that you want applied to the latest draft (draft 6), Copilot instead applies it to draft 4, because that's the draft currently displayed. In this example, you should have navigated back to draft 6 of 6 before entering the prompt.

1. Ensure you're on draft **2 of 2**. In looking through the Summary, you were concerned with the language in the Termination section. It wasn't as clear as you would have preferred. You want Copilot to revise this section, so enter the following prompt: **Suggest language to clarify the section on Termination of the supplier agreement. Suggest language to clarify the section on Termination of the supplier agreement. Display the entire revised Summary document**.
1. The updated draft is now draft 3 of 3. Use your back arrow to go back to draft 2 of 3 and check out the language in the previous Termination section. Now go back to draft 3 of 3 and compare that previous language with the revised language. Note the changes that Copilot made in this latest version. 
1. You now want Copilot to focus on the contract's payment terms. Ensure you're on draft **3 of 3** and then enter the following prompt: **Compare the payment terms in the supplier agreement with standard industry practices. Highlight any deviations in the Summary document. Display the entire revised Summary document**.
1. The revised payment term section that includes the industry comparison looks good. You now want Copilot to visualize responsibilities between Tailspin Toys and VanArsdel. To do so, enter the following prompt, which you feel is useful for stakeholders during the contract management process: **At the end of the Summary document, create a table summarizing the obligations of each party, including deadlines or conditions. Display the entire revised Summary document**.
1. The table looks good, but in reviewing the Summary document one last time, you feel that it would be more visually attractive if the red flags and deviations were displayed in a red font. To do so, enter the following prompt: **To make the document more visually appealing, can you display the red flags and deviations in a red font to make them stand out. Display the entire revised Summary document**.
1. Since you're satisfied with this final version of the Summary, select the **Keep it** button in the prompt field. 
1. You aren't using this document in any upcoming exercises, so you can close the tab in your Edge browser.
