# Draft legal guidance on a new regulation using Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat
---
Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat brings the power of generative AI into a simple, conversational format that fits seamlessly into the legal professional's day-to-day work. Unlike traditional research tools or document templates, Copilot Chat allows legal teams to ask specific, nuanced questions and receive tailored responses in real time—whether you're exploring the implications of a regulation, preparing internal guidance, or comparing clauses across agreements. It's like having a legal assistant on call to help you process information, draft summaries, and stay ahead of complex demands.

For in-house legal teams, Copilot Chat is especially useful when working cross-functionally with business leaders who need timely, accurate answers to regulatory questions or contract terms. Instead of digging through dense documents or lengthy threads, legal professionals can use Copilot to quickly gather relevant context, generate working drafts of internal briefs, and suggest action items for other departments. This ability to combine legal insight with AI-generated clarity can dramatically reduce the time spent on early-stage drafting and research.

Using Copilot Chat empowers legal teams to respond faster, communicate more clearly, and remain proactive in guiding the organization through legal risk and change. Whether you're summarizing a new law, preparing a Q&A for a policy rollout, or translating legal language into business terms, Copilot Chat helps you do more with less, while still keeping expert review and oversight firmly in your hands.

## Exercise

As a Paralegal for Domestic Operations at Tailspin Toys, you were assigned to support the Legal team in drafting an internal guidance brief on the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and its enhancement, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA). These laws represent some of the most comprehensive data privacy regulations in the United States and are designed to give California residents greater control over their personal information.

Although Tailspin Toys has operated in California for several years, it previously never met all the thresholds required for compliance. Specifically, the CCPA and CPRA apply to businesses that:

- Operate in California.
- Have annual gross revenues exceeding $25 million.
- Buy, sell, or share the personal information of 100,000 or more California residents, households, or devices.

Due to recent business growth—including an expansion in the collection and handling of personal data, along with projected revenue increases—Tailspin anticipates that it should meet the applicability thresholds in the upcoming fiscal year. As a result, the company is proactively preparing to ensure full compliance.

Your role is to support the Legal department by producing two key deliverables that can inform Tailspin Toys' preparation for CCPA and CPRA compliance. To streamline your research and drafting process, you want to use Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat to explore the regulations and generate clear, actionable content for both legal and non-legal audiences.

Your two main objectives are:
- Summarize the key provisions of the CCPA and CPRA, with a focus on how they apply specifically to Tailspin Toys' business model and operations. This summary is intended for the Legal department and should include relevant regulatory definitions, thresholds, obligations, and enforcement risks.
- Draft a one-page legal brief tailored to department heads across IT, Marketing, and Product Development. This document should outline the next steps each team must take to help the company achieve compliance. Avoid legal jargon—write in plain, accessible language that makes it easy for non-legal stakeholders to understand their responsibilities and timelines.

Perform the following steps to create a concise and actionable legal guidance brief that can be distributed across the organization to address the new regulatory changes efficiently:

1. In **Microsoft Edge**, open a new tab and enter the following URL: [**https://M365copilot.com**](https://M365copilot.com)
1. Depending on which Copilot plan you're using, your **Copilot** page displays either a **Work/Web** toggle or it accesses Web content only. If your Copilot page has a **Work/Web** toggle, then select the **Web** toggle switch.
1. In the prompt field, enter the following prompt and then select the Submit icon: **I'm a Paralegal at Tailspin Toys, a U.S.-based toy manufacturer and distributor. Please create a summary document outlining the key provisions of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA). This document is intended for the Legal department and should include relevant regulatory definitions, applicability thresholds, business obligations, enforcement mechanisms, and potential risks. The summary should focus on how these laws impact Tailspin Toys' ability to collect, store, and process personal information from U.S residents**.
1. Review the summary created by Copilot Chat. While you feel it’s a good starting point, you’re concerned that it needs to do more to support IT and Legal in establishing retention schedules, deletion protocols, and user data access system. To address this shortcoming, enter the following prompt: **Add another section that summarizes how CCPA and CPRA impact data retention and deletion policies at Tailspin Toys. Provide recommendations to ensure compliance, particularly regarding user rights like data deletion, correction, and access**.
1. You now want Copilot Chat to address privacy-by-design practices and build cross-functional awareness. To do so, enter the following prompt: **Add another section that provides an action plan for the Product Development team at Tailspin Toys to help ensure new digital products are compliant with CCPA and CPRA from launch**.
1. At this point, you’re satisfied with the breadth of the document. However, you feel that it might be helpful to the Legal personnel if you create a crosswalk table, which should allow them to quickly see what’s changed and what needs updated attention. To do so, enter the following prompt: **Create a table in this document that compares CCPA and CPRA provisions side by side, highlighting any new or expanded obligations under CPRA**.
1. In our testing, Copilot sometimes displayed the comparison table in the Chat page, and other times it created a separate document containing the table (for which it provided a link to the document). If it provides a link to a document, select the link and open the document to verify it looks OK. 
1. At this point, you feel this Summary document is complete, so you want to save it for distribution to members of the Legal department’s project team assigned to this initiative. Since Copilot Chat responded to each of your prompts with separate responses that weren’t combined into one document, you want it to do so now. Enter the following prompt (note the last sentence in the prompt, which directs Copilot to include the table in the prompt in case it had previously placed the table in a separate document): **Can you please combine all the information that you generated in your previous responses into one document that I can download. Make sure you include the comparison table**.
1. Copilot Chat should generate a single document that combines all the information from its prior responses. If it previously created a separate document for the comparison table, it may display the link for that document as well. Select the link to download the Word document containing all the sections and then open the file once the download is complete. Verify that all the information you requested is in the document, along with the table at the end. Once you’re done, close the Word document and return to your Edge browser, which should still be on your Copilot Chat tab. 
1. You're now ready to address the second requirement for this project. You want Copilot to draft a legal brief tailored to department heads across IT, Marketing, and Product Development. This document should outline the next steps each team must take to help the company achieve compliance. To create this legal brief, enter the following prompt: **Please outline the next steps that the IT, Marketing, and Product Development teams at Tailspin Toys must take to help the company comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA). The text should be in the form of a legal brief that’s tailored to the heads of each of these three departments. Use plain, accessible language and avoid legal jargon so that non-legal stakeholders can easily understand their responsibilities. Focus on practical actions, recommended timelines, and how each department's work supports overall compliance**.
1. In our testing, Copilot Chat sometimes created a document containing the legal brief. Other times, it displayed the content of the document in the Copilot Chat pane. If it created a document, select the link to download the document and then open it to review the contents. 
1. While this legal brief provides a summarization of the next steps, you feel it could be more effective if you turned it into an actionable planning tool. To do so, enter the following prompt: **This looks good. But to make it more effective, update the existing document by adding a simple compliance timeline or checklist that shows what actions should be completed in the next 30, 60, and 90 days**.
1. Select the link to download the document and then open the file once the download is complete. In our testing, Copilot Chat added the compliance timeline to the wrong document. It added it to the Summary document rather than the one-page legal brief. If Copilot Chat added the compliance timeline to the one-page legal brief, then close your Word document and proceed to the next step. Otherwise, if this mistake also happened to you, then close the Word document and enter the following prompt: You added this compliance timeline to the wrong document. You added it to the overview document that you generated earlier. Please add it to the one-page legal brief that you created. Select the link to the updated document and verify that Copilot Chat entered the compliance timeline information to the legal brief. Close the Word document. 
1. Finally, you want stakeholders to understand the risks should the company not comply with these regulations. You want to reinforce urgency and help stakeholders understand why these steps matter. To do so, enter the following prompt: **Enhance this one-page legal brief by including a short section that explains the potential risks of non-compliance with CCPA and CPRA, using plain language**.
1. Select the link to the updated document and verify that Copilot Chat added a section on the potential risks of non-compliance. Close the Word document.
1. While your initial directive was to create a one-page legal brief that covers IT, Marketing, and Product Development, you feel that it might be more effective to also create three separate documents—one for each department that includes department-specific requirements. In doing so, the first legal brief that Copilot Chat created that combined all the departments into one document can be targeted towards senior management. Conversely, the individual legal brief for each department enables department heads to get only what they need, without extra context. Enter the following prompt for the Marketing department brief: **Based on the key provisions of CCPA and CPRA, create another legal brief that identifies specific implications for Tailspin Toys' Marketing department. Consider how these regulations affect digital advertising, customer data collection, and user consent practices**.
1. Select the link to download the Marketing Department document and then open the file once the download is complete. Verify that all the information you requested is in the document. Once you're done, close the document and return to your Edge browser, which should still be on your Copilot Chat tab.
1. Now enter the following prompt for the IT department brief: **Based on the key provisions of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), create another legal brief that identifies specific implications for the IT department at Tailspin Toys. Focus on areas such as data security, user access requests, data deletion protocols, and system logging. Provide actionable recommendations to ensure technical compliance with the regulations**.
1. Select the link to download the IT Department document and then open the file once the download is complete. Verify that all the information you requested is in the document. Once you're done, close the document and return to your Edge browser, which should still be on your Copilot Chat tab.
1. Lastly, enter the following prompt for the Product Development brief: **Based on the key provisions of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), create another legal brief that identifies how they affect the Product Development team at Tailspin Toys. Focus on privacy-by-design principles, default data collection settings, and consent mechanisms in new digital products. Provide recommendations to help ensure products are compliant with privacy regulations from initial design through launch**.
1. Select the link to download the Product Development document and then open the file once the download is complete. Verify that all the information you requested is in the document
