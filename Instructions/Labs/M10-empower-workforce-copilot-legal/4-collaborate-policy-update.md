# Collaborate on a policy update using Microsoft 365 Copilot in Loop.
---
Microsoft Loop is a flexible, real-time collaboration platform that enables teams to co-create documents and manage evolving workstreams with ease. For legal professionals, Loop—with Copilot integrated—offers a unique opportunity to collaborate on complex legal content across departments while keeping everything organized, editable, and up to date. Whether drafting a policy, coordinating with HR and IT on compliance updates, or developing legal playbooks, Loop provides a centralized space where legal input can be structured and continuously refined.

Copilot in Loop enhances this collaboration by helping you quickly generate initial drafts, outline policies, or break down legal guidance into clear sections. It can suggest structure for legal documents, tag action items for different stakeholders, and help distill dense legal topics into language suitable for non-legal audiences. Legal teams can work in tandem with business units in real time, using Copilot to keep the document moving forward—even before a formal legal review is complete.

Using Copilot in Loop allows legal professionals to stay agile while maintaining control. It bridges the gap between legal insight and operational execution by turning shared documents into living resources that evolve with input from legal, compliance, HR, and other partners—all without losing clarity or structure along the way.

## Exercise

As a Paralegal at Adatum Corporation, you're part of a cross-functional team tasked with updating the company's Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to reflect new guidelines for remote work. With an increasing number of employees working from home, there's a growing need to address how devices, data access, and security protocols should be managed in a remote environment. Legal, IT, and HR have come together to ensure the policy is comprehensive, clear, and compliant with current regulations while aligning with the company's operational needs. Your role is to collaborate with these teams, using Copilot in Microsoft Loop to co-draft and refine the updated policy. Your goal is to ensure that all necessary elements are covered and the policy is aligned across departments.

To facilitate collaboration, you plan to use Copilot in Loop to help draft and revise key sections of the policy. Copilot can assist in generating content for device use, access control, and security measures. You also plan work with IT and HR to add actionable items, such as ensuring that personal devices are used securely, and tag specific tasks for each department to ensure alignment. Once the policy is collaboratively reviewed and finalized, you can convert it into a Word or PDF document for distribution and publication across the company. This exercise helps ensure that all relevant stakeholders contribute to the policy, making it clear and enforceable while also improving communication and efficiency within the team.

Perform the following steps to use Copilot in Loop to co-draft and revise policy documents:

1. In **Microsoft 365**, select **Loop** if it appears in the left-hand navigation pane. If it doesn't appear there, then select **Apps**, and on the **Apps** page, scroll down to locate **Loop** and then select it.
1. In **Loop**, the **Workspaces** tab is displayed by default. You want to create a new workspace for this project, so select the **Create new** (plus sign) icon in the navigation pane on the left. In the menu that appears, select **New workspace**.
1. In the **Create a new workspace** window, you must assign your workspace a name. Enter **AUP Update - Remote Work Guidelines** in the **Type a name** field and then select the **Create** button.
1. You're now on the first page for your new workspace. The name of the page is currently **Untitled**. Note the page (**Untitled**) also appears in the middle navigation pane. In the main body of the page, select in the **Untitled** field and change the name of the page to **Draft Policy Sections**. Note how the page name is automatically updated in the middle navigation pane.
1. You want to create two more pages for this workspace. In the middle navigation pane, select the plus sign (+) to create a new page, and then in the menu that appears, select **Page**. Repeat the prior step to name this new page **Departmental Input & Review**. Then repeat this step to add a third page titled **Task Tracker & Assignments**. 
1. The **AUP Update - Remote Work Guidelines** workspace should now include these three pages. However, the pages appear in the reverse order from which they were created, so that the last page appears first. You want to rearrange their order, so select on the **Draft Policy Sections** page in the navigation pane and drag and drop it to the top of the list. Then repeat this process for the **Departmental Input & Review** page to move it up to the second page. The pages should appear in this order: 
   - Draft Policy Sections 
   - Departmental Input & Review
   - Task Tracker & Assignments

1. Select the **Draft Policy Sections** page. With Loop, you can use Copilot in one of two ways. If you enter a prompt in the Copilot field that appears below the page heading, Copilot can generate text associated with your prompt. However, if you ask it to add another section of content, it replaces the first section of text with the response to your second request. Replacing the first section of text isn’t what you want. Instead, you want to enter multiple prompts, where each prompt asks Copilot to generate text for specific requests. To do this, you must open the **Copilot** pane, enter your prompt, and then copy Copilot's response and paste it into the Loop page at the desired location. To open the **Copilot** pane, select the **Copilot** icon that appears in the upper-right side of the page, next to the **Share** button.
1. In the Copilot pane that appears, enter the following prompt to have Copilot create a **Device Usage** section on this **Draft Policy Sections** page: **Adatum Corporation is updating its Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to reflect new guidelines for remote work. With an increasing number of employees working from home, there's a growing need to address how devices, data access, and security protocols should be managed in a remote environment. In this workspace that outlines the company's remote work guidelines, draft a Device Usage section. Include sample language on the use of personal versus. company-issued devices, and basic security expectations**.
1. Review Copilot's response. Since it looks like a good starting point, select the **Copy** icon that appears below Copilot's response. Copilot sometimes displays a **Copied to clipboard** message once it successfully copies the text; other times it doesn’t. To paste this content into the Loop page, select on the page below the page heading and enter **Ctrl+V**. Review the text that was pasted on the page. If the text doesn’t paste in, then it wasn’t successfully copied. If this situation occurs, then select the **Copy** icon and try pasting it again. Continue with this process until you successfully paste in the copied text.  Note how Copilot copies not only its response, but also the conversational text that appeared along with the response in the Copilot pane (for example, "Sure [your name]! Here's a draft…"). Highlight this text and delete it from the page. Scroll down to the end of Copilot's response that you pasted on the page. Sometimes Copilot includes conversational text here as well that you should delete (for example, "Feel free to adjust the language…"). Highlight and delete any conversational text that appears at the end of Copilot's response. 
1. In the Copilot pane, enter the following prompt to have Copilot create an **Access Control** section in the Loop workspace: **Draft an Access Control section. This section should examine VPN use, user authentication, access logs, and so on**.
1. Review Copilot’s response. Since it looks good, select the **Copy** icon that appears below Copilot's response. Select into the document so that your cursor is at the bottom of the document following the previous section and then enter **Ctrl+V** to paste in the copied text. As before, if the text didn’t paste in, then repeat the copy and paste process until it does so. Review the text that was pasted on the page and delete any conversational text that appears at both the start and end of the response.
1. In the Copilot pane, enter the following prompt to have Copilot create a **Security Measures** section: **Draft a Security Measures section. This section should examine data encryption, incident reporting protocols, and so on**.
1. Review Copilot’s response. Since it looks good, select the **Copy** icon that appears below Copilot's response. Select into the document so that your cursor is at the bottom of the document following the previous section and then enter **Ctrl+V** to paste in the copied text. As before, if the text didn’t paste in, then repeat the copy and paste process until it does so. Review the text that was pasted on the page and delete any conversational text that appears at both the start and end of the response.
1. That concludes the **Draft Policy Sections** page. Now select the **Departmental Input & Review** page in the worksheet menu. For this page, you want to invite collaborators from **Legal**, **IT**, and **HR** into the Loop workspace to review and provide feedback on the relevant sections generated by Copilot on the previous **Draft Policy Sections** page. So on this **Departmental Input & Review** page, you want Copilot to create a subheading for each department, with a blank space between headings. This blank space is where the collaborators can enter feedback for their respective department. To do so, you're not going to use the Copilot pane. Instead, you want to enter your prompt request in the Copilot window that appears below the page title. Hover over the prompt field that says "Use Copilot or just start typing," which triggers Copilot to display a plus sign (+). Select the **plus sign** (+), and in the menu that appears, select **Draft page content**. In the Copilot prompt field that appears, enter the following prompt and select the **Submit** icon: **Can you add three blank sections on this page with the following section headings: Legal, IT, and Human Resources. Representatives from each department can then enter their feedback below their respective department heading**. 
1. Review the headings. Delete any extraneous text that Copilot may have inserted before or after the sections (for example, if it repeated the page title prior to the first section). 
1. That concludes the **Departmental Input & Review** page. Now select the **Task Tracker and Assignment** page in the worksheet menu. For this page, you want Copilot to create a table that contains a list of potential actionable items for each department.  You want to enter your prompt request in the Copilot window that appears below the page title rather than in the Copilot pane. Hover over the prompt field that appears below the page title and then select the **plus sign (+)** that appears. In the drop-down menu, select **Draft page content**. In the Copilot prompt field that appears, enter the following prompt and select the **Submit** icon: **Create three tables, one for each of the following departments: Legal, IT, and Human Resources. In each table, include a list of potential actionable items for that department. The first column in each table should provide a name for the action (for example, device audits, employee training, and policy communication), while the second column in each table should provide a short description of the action**.  
1. Review the three tables with actionable items that Copilot generated. In a real-world scenario, you could continue fine tuning the document. For example, you could have Copilot offer suggestions for any improvements or clarifications, or you could have it check for consistency on tone and language. However, given the time constraints of this training exercise, you can close this Loop tab in your Edge browser.
