As an Associate Counsel at Boulder Innovations, you're tasked with reviewing a new supplier agreement for a potential partnership with VanArsdel, Ltd. The plan is for VanArsdel to supply materials for the company’s new toy line of remote-controlled cars. The contract is lengthy, and while you need to ensure all the key terms align with Boulder Innovations’ business objectives, there’s a tight deadline to summarize the document for senior management. You must distill the most important details of the agreement—such as terms related to payment, termination, liability, and governing law—into a clear, concise summary that internal stakeholders can quickly review.

To streamline this process, you plan to use Copilot in Word to automatically generate a summary of the contract, flag any potential red flags or unusual clauses, and provide suggestions for improving unclear sections. Copilot can help you focus on critical areas like indemnity clauses and termination terms, allowing you to identify any risks or areas for clarification. By utilizing Copilot’s suggestions and formatting tools, you can create a clear summary that you can easily share with other departments and leadership, ensuring Boulder management makes informed decisions before moving forward with the vendor.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  Select the following link to open a copy of [VanArsdel Supplier Agreement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2320506). Select the **Download** button at the top of the screen to download the file to your computer, and then store the file in your OneDrive folder.

2.  In your Microsoft Edge browser, go to the **Microsoft 365** home page, select **Apps** in the navigation pane, and then select **Word** from the **Apps** menu.

3.  In **Word for the web**, open the **VanArsdel Supplier Agreement** document that you downloaded. You should then open the Copilot pane by selecting Copilot in the Word ribbon. Doing so enables you to use Copilot to generate the summary from the open document.

    > [!TIP]
    > Opening a document in Word and then using the Copilot pane to generate a document based on it provides Copilot with full context of the open file. You can then explicitly ask Copilot to create the summary in a new document, which leaves the original contract untouched.

4.  In the Copilot pane, use a prompt that binds Copilot to the current open document and requests a separate output. Ask Copilot to summarize the currently open VanArsdel Supplier Agreement in 5–7 bullet points. Focus on term/renewal, termination, payment terms, liability/indemnity, data handling (privacy, retention, breach notification), governing law, and dispute resolution. Add a “Red Flags & Deviations” section in red font. This section should highlight any unusual clauses or red flags in the Indemnity and Termination sections. Create the summary in a new downloadable document titled “VanArsdel Supplier Agreement – Executive Summary,” and include a short “Key Risks & Deviations” section at the end.

5.  Copilot should provide a link to the downloadable **VanArsdel Supplier Agreement – Executive Summary** document. Don’t download the summary yet, as you plan to review the document and possibly make changes.

6.  In looking through the **VanArsdel Supplier Agreement**, you were concerned with the language related to Termination. It wasn’t as clear as you would like. Ask Copilot to suggest language to clarify the section on Termination of the supplier agreement and include this content in the “Red Flags & Deviations” section.

7.  Review the content that Copilot displays in the Copilot pane. Ignore the link to download the updated summary document.

8.  You now want Copilot to focus on the contract’s payment terms. Ask Copilot to add a section in the Executive Summary that compares the payment terms in the supplier agreement with standard industry practices. Highlight any deviations in this new section in the Executive Summary document.

9.  Review the content update that Copilot displays in the Copilot pane. Ignore the link to download the updated summary document.

10.  Finally, you want Copilot to visualize responsibilities between Boulder Innovations and VanArsdel. You feel that this type of visualization can be useful for stakeholders during the contract management process. Ask Copilot to create a section at the end of the Executive Summary document that provides a breakdown of responsibilities. It should include a table that summarizes the obligations of Boulder Innovations and VanArsdel, Ltd., including deadlines or conditions (columns: Obligation, Party, Trigger, Timeframe, Risk).

11.  You can’t think of any more items that you want to include in the Executive Summary, so select the final download link that Copilot provided following this last change request. Open the summary once the file is downloaded.

12.  Review the Executive Summary document and verify that the changes you requested after the initial prompt are included.
