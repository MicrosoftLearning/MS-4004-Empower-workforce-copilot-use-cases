As Boulder Innovations prepares for its state regulatory audit under heightened data‑protection scrutiny, leadership is asking the company’s Legal Department to provide a clear, high‑level summary of the issues that regulators typically investigate. Because Boulder’s product line includes smart play products and connected devices, regulators are focused on privacy, telemetry collection, consumer data retention, and cross‑border data storage practices.

Your role as Associate Counsel is to help the Legal team quickly gather external context on what enforcement agencies prioritize during audits. You plan to use Copilot’s Researcher agent to pull together a concise, regulator‑facing brief that distills the most common risk areas, demonstrates organizational awareness, and helps Boulder show proactive due diligence. You plan to share this brief with the Audit Prep Committee as part of Boulder’s preaudit readiness packet.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

1.  In your Microsoft Edge browser, go to the **Microsoft 365** home page and select **Researcher** from the list of agents in the navigation pane.

2.  Ask the Researcher agent to research common regulatory investigative themes under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and its enhancement, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA). Identify the top emerging legal risks and enforcement trends.

3.  Review Researcher’s findings. Then ask Copilot to draft a one to two page Risk Brief document that summarizes the findings in plain language for executives.

4.  Review the document that Copilot generated. To make your findings more proactive, ask Researcher to add a section at the bottom of the risk brief titled: “Recommended Immediate Actions for Audit Prep.” This section should include five practical next steps a company should take before a state audit.

5.  If Researcher provides a suggested prompt to summarize the key risks in a table, then select the prompt and submit it. If it doesn’t display this request in a suggested prompt, then submit this request yourself.

6.  If Researcher follows up this table with a suggested prompt to add a second column with recommended actions for each risk to make this table actionable for executives, then select the prompt and submit it. If it doesn’t display this request in a suggested prompt, then submit this request yourself.

7.  If Researcher displayed the updated table as a separate response rather than including it in the risk brief, then ask it to combine the table and risk brief into one document. If it suggested this action in a suggested prompt, then select and submit it; otherwise, submit this request yourself.

8.  Ask Researcher to turn this risk brief into a downloadable Word document. Save the document to your OneDrive as **Boulder Risk Brief – Executive Summary.docx**.

9.  If Researcher can’t generate a downloadable document (which it couldn’t do during our testing), then perform the following steps:

    1. Select the **Copy response** icon that appears at the end of the content.

    1. Open a blank document in Word and paste in the copied text.

    1. Delete any extraneous content that was copied and pasted in from your chat with Researcher. Extraneous content usually appears at the beginning and end of the content.

    1. Reformat the title and section headings using Word heading styles to make them more appealing. Make any other formatting changes that you wish.

    1. Save the document to your OneDrive as **Boulder Risk Brief – Executive Summary.docx**.
