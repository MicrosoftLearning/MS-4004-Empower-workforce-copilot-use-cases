# Visualize a risk assessment framework using Microsoft 365 Copilot in Excel
---
Microsoft Excel has long been a go-to tool for data organization, but with the integration of Copilot, it becomes a dynamic platform for legal professionals to structure, analyze, and visualize complex legal risk frameworks. Instead of relying solely on narrative reports or presentations, legal teams can now use Excel to build risk matrices, track compliance gaps, and organize mitigation strategies in a format that is both data-driven and easy to collaborate on.

Copilot in Excel enables users to generate and populate structured tables, apply conditional formatting, categorize risks by Likelihood and Impact, and develop actionable insights—all with simple natural language prompts. Whether assessing regulatory exposure, managing contractual obligations, or supporting internal audits, legal professionals can use Excel to convert legal complexity into structured, trackable data.

For this reason, Excel is an ideal environment for legal teams working alongside departments like HR, IT, Finance, or Compliance. By using Copilot to create clear visualizations of risk levels and responsibilities, legal professionals can promote alignment, drive accountability, and enhance the organization's ability to proactively manage legal and regulatory obligations.

## Exercise

At Adatum Corporation, the Legal team is working on building a comprehensive risk assessment framework to identify and categorize potential legal or compliance risks within the business. With increasing regulations and the complexity of managing multiple legal requirements, the team wants to streamline their risk management process. To do so, they need a visual tool that helps them map out the risks and their associated mitigation strategies. You want to use Excel to help organize the data into a risk matrix and identify high-priority risks and action items. This information can then be presented to department heads for further review and collaboration.

Your role is to guide the team in using Copilot in Excel to generate a 2x2 risk matrix, with axis for Likelihood and Impact. Copilot can then add key legal risks such as Data Privacy Violations, Breach of Contract, IP Infringement, and Non-Compliance with Labor Laws, categorizing them based on their risk levels. You want Copilot to color-code each quadrant to reflect the risk priority and help suggest mitigation actions for each identified risk. You also want to add a section for open questions, which can facilitate further legal review and discussion. This visual risk assessment should be a valuable tool for the Legal team to communicate with other departments, ensuring alignment and action on key compliance risks across Adatum Corporation.

Perform the following steps to create a 2x2 risk matrix that visualizes and organizes legal risks based on likelihood and impact:

1. If you have a Microsoft 365 tab open in your Microsoft Edge browser, then select it now; otherwise, open a new tab and enter the following URL: [**https://www.office.com**](https://www.office.com)
1. On the **Microsoft 365** home page, select the **Excel** icon if it appears in the navigation pane. Otherwise, select **Apps** in the navigation pane, and then on the **Apps** page, select **Excel**. 
1. In **Excel**, on the **File** page, select **Create blank workbook**.
1. In the **Start with Copilot** window that appears, enter the following prompt: **Create a 2x2 risk matrix table. It should compare Low and High Likelihood to Low and High Impact. Display Likelihood/Impact in cell A1. Leave the cells within the table blank for now**.
1. Review the matrix table that Copilot created. You now want to populate the matrix with legal risks in appropriate cells based on their Likelihood and Impact. To do so, enter the following prompt in the Copilot window that appears towards the bottom of the worksheet: **Populate the matrix with the following four legal risks in appropriate cells based on their Likelihood and Impact: "Data Privacy Violations: High Likelihood, High Impact," "Breach of Contract: Low Likelihood, High Impact," "IP Infringement: High Likelihood, Low Impact," and "Non-Compliance with Labor Laws: Low Likelihood, Low Impact**."
1. Verify that Copilot listed each legal risk in the correct cell based on its likelihood and impact. To make the row headings stand out from the actual data in the table, enter the following prompt: **Bold the values in cells A2 and A3**.
1. At this point, you're satisfied with the risk matrix, so select the **Keep it** button in the Copilot window. 
1. Later, you realize that you want to add mitigation strategies in a separate work sheet. Since you're now dealing with multiple sheets, you want to make their names more user-friendly than just Sheet1 and Sheet2. At the bottom of the workbook, right-click on **Sheet1** and in the menu that appears, select **Rename**. Then type **Risk Matrix** and select Enter. Now select the **Plus sign (+)** next to the **Risk Matrix** sheet to add another sheet. Right-click on the new sheet, select **Rename** in the menu, type **Mitigation Strategies**, and then select Enter. 
1. Since you kept the **Risk Matrix** draft and made it an actual sheet, the Copilot window no longer appears. Therefore, to have Copilot help you create the **Mitigation Strategies** sheet, you must use the Copilot pane. To do so, select **Copilot** that appears at the end of the **Home** tab ribbon. 
1. In the **Mitigation Strategies** sheet, you want Copilot to create a table for mitigation actions. To do so, enter the following prompt in the Copilot pane: **Create a table with two columns: ‘Legal Risk' and ‘Mitigation Strategy.' In the Legal Risk column, include the following risks: Data Privacy Violations, Breach of Contract, IP Infringement, and Non-Compliance with Labor Laws. In the Mitigation Strategy column, suggest mitigation strategies for each risk**.
1. Review the mitigation strategies that Copilot displayed in the Copilot pane. You’re happy with the results, so select the **+Insert to new sheet** button that appears below the table.   
1. You now want Copilot to generate a list of questions for legal review in a separate work sheet. At the bottom of the workbook, select the **Plus sign (+)** next to the **Mitigation Strategies** to add a new sheet. Right-click on the new sheet, select **Rename** in the menu, and then enter **Open Legal Questions** as the new name for the sheet. 
1. In the **Open Legal Questions** sheet, you want Copilot to generate a list of open questions for legal review. To do so, enter the following prompt: **Create a list titled ‘Open Questions for Legal Review'. Include 10 questions. These should be open-ended legal questions that help identify compliance gaps, clarify ownership of risk, and prompt strategic legal discussion. The questions should encourage deeper legal review and collaboration with other departments**.
1. Review the open legal questions that Copilot generated. In our testing, sometimes Copilot displayed an **+Insert to new sheet** button below the questions, and other times it didn’t. If the **+Insert to new sheet** button appears, then select it. Otherwise, highlight the questions in the Copilot pane, copy them (**Ctrl+C**), and then paste them (**Ctrl+V**) in the sheet. 
1. Feel free to have Copilot make other changes to any of the worksheets. For example, to format for readability and sharing, you could optionally adjust column widths and center text in the risk matrix table. Or you could add a title row across the top of each worksheet that says **Adatum Legal Risk Assessment**.
1. Once you finish updating the sheets in this workbook, you can close this tab in your Edge browser.
