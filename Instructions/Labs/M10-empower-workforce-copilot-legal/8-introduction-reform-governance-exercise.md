# Exercise 2: Reform corporate governance and compliance using Microsoft 365 Copilot
---
When internal audits reveal compliance weaknesses, outdated policies, or inconsistent governance practices, organizations must respond quickly and clearly. Microsoft 365 Copilot provides legal teams with an integrated set of tools to modernize policies, assess risk, coordinate with departments, and build stronger compliance cultures. Instead of drafting policies from scratch or manually assembling risk data, Copilot helps legal professionals generate structure, source insights, and maintain alignment across teams. For example:

- Copilot in Loop enables cross‑department collaboration on policy drafts, helping legal, HR, IT, and operational teams contribute to a single, always‑current document.

- Copilot in Excel provides a powerful way to visualize risk, categorize exposure, and prioritize mitigation activities, all of which are essential for audit committees and leadership reporting.

- Copilot in PowerPoint and OneNote helps translate legal requirements into formats that are accessible to executives and operational staff, from briefing decks to compliance checklists.

By weaving AI assistance throughout the policy‑writing, risk‑assessment, and compliance‑communication process, companies can create more consistent governance frameworks and reduce the administrative burden on legal teams. The result is a faster, clearer, and more collaborative approach to legal compliance and corporate oversight.

This exercise demonstrates how Microsoft 365 Copilot supports organizations in strengthening governance, refining internal policies, visualizing compliance risks, and creating the communication assets needed to ensure ongoing regulatory readiness.

### Scenario

In this exercise, you take on the role of Corporate Counsel for Lamna Healthcare Company, a mid‑sized medical device manufacturer known for its innovative remote‑monitoring devices and digital‑health platforms. Lamna operates in a heavily regulated environment, one where clinical safety, data security, and traceability are non‑negotiable and where even small governance gaps can trigger significant regulatory scrutiny.

Last week, Lamna’s Internal Audit Committee delivered a comprehensive, highly critical governance review. This review followed a series of potential compliance lapses across multiple departments. The audit didn’t identify a single catastrophic failure, but instead revealed a pattern of small but compounding weaknesses that, together, represent systemic governance risk. Key findings included:

- **Device traceability gaps** in several regional operations—disconnected spreadsheets, inconsistent chain‑of‑custody documentation, and manual reconciliation workarounds that bypass approved processes.

- **Remote‑work security inconsistencies**, including outdated access‑control guidance, uneven multifactor authentication (MFA) enforcement, and departments creating their own temporary exceptions to security protocols.

- **Cross‑department accountability confusion**, including unclear ownership of compliance tasks across Legal, Clinical Operations, IT Security, and HR. Multiple policies remained unexamined for  3–5 years, with overlapping versions circulating across departments.

- **Ineffective governance cadence**, including committees that meet irregularly, escalation paths that aren’t followed, and an absence of structured reporting mechanisms that leadership can rely on for certification and attestation reviews.

In response, Lamna’s Board mandated a rapid, organization-wide governance overhaul. The Legal department—known internally for its structured frameworks and clear communication—is asked to lead a cross‑functional reform initiative designed to reset the company’s governance foundation.
